Chapter I

During an interval in the Melvinski trial in the large
building of the Law Courts the members and public
prosecutor met in Ivan Egorovich Shebek's private
room, where the conversation turned on the celebrated
Krasovski case. Fedor Vasilievich warmly maintained
that it was not subject to their jurisdiction, Ivan
Egorovich maintained the contrary, while Peter
Ivanovich, not having entered into the discussion at
the start, took no part in it but looked through the
Gazette which had just been handed in.

“Gentlemen,” he said, “Ivan Ilych has died!”
“You don't say so!”

“Here, read it yourself,” replied Peter Ivanovich,
handing Fedor Vasilievich the paper still damp from
the press. Surrounded by a black border were the
words: “Praskovya Fedorovna Golovina, with profound
sorrow, informs relatives and friends of the demise
of her beloved husband Ivan Ilych Golovin, Member
of the Court of Justice, which occurred on February
the 4th of this year 1882. The funeral will take place
on Friday at one o'clock in the afternoon.”

Ivan Ilych had been a colleague of the gentlemen
present and was liked by them all. He had been ill for

some weeks with an illness said to be incurable.
His post had been kept open for him, but there
had been conjectures that in case of his death
Alexeev might receive his appointment, and that
either Vinnikov or Shtabel would succeed Alexeev.
So on receiving the news of Ivan Ilych's death the
first thought of each of the gentlemen in that pri-
vate room was of the changes and promotions it
might occasion among themselves or their acquain-
tances.

“I shall be sure to get Shtabel's place or Vin-
nikov's,” thought Fedor Vasilievich. “I was promised
that long ago, and the promotion means an extra
eight hundred rubles a year for me besides the
allowance.”

“Now I must apply for my brother-in-law's transfer
from Kaluga,” thought Peter Ivanovich. “My wife
will be very glad, and then she won't be able to
say that I never do anything for her relations.”

“I thought he would never leave his bed again,”
said Peter Ivanovich aloud. “It's very sad.”

“But what really was the matter with him?”

“The doctors couldn't say - at least they could,
but each of them said something different. When
last I saw him I though he was getting better.”

“And I haven't been to see him since the holidays.
I always meant to go.”

“Had he any property?”

“I think his wife had a little - but something quiet
trifling.”

“We shall have to go to see her, but they live so
terribly far away.”

“Far away from you, you mean. Everything's far
away from your place.”

“You see, he never can forgive my living on the
other side of the river,” said Peter Ivanovich,
smiling at Shebek. Then, still talking of the dis-
tances between different parts of the city, they
returned to the Court.

Besides considerations as to the possible transfers
and promotions likely to result from Ivan Ilych's
death, the mere fact of the death of a near acquain-
tance aroused, as usual, in all who heard of it the
complacent feeling that, “it is he who is dead and
not 1.”

Each one thought or felt, “Well, he's dead but I'm
alive!” But the more intimate of Ivan Ilych's ac-
quaintances, his so-called friends, could not help

thinking also that they would now have to fulfil
the very tiresome demands of propriety by attend-
ing the funeral service and paying a visit of condo-
lence to the widow.

Fedor Vasilievich and Peter Ivanovich had been
his nearest acquaintances. Peter Ivanovich had
studied law with Ivan Ilych and had considered
himself to be under obligations to him.

Having told his wife at dinner-time of Ivan Ilych's
death, and of his conjecture that it might be pos-
sible to get her brother transferred to their circuit,
Peter Ivanovich sacrificed his usual nap, put on
his evening clothes and drove to Ivan Ilych's
house.

At the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs.
Leaning against the wall in the hall downstairs
near the cloakstand was a coffin-lid covered with
cloth of gold, ornamented with gold cord and tas-
sels, that had been polished up with metal powder.
Two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks.
Peter Ivanovich recognized one of them as Ivan
Ilych's sister, but the other was a stranger to him.
His colleague Schwartz was just coming down-
stairs, but on seeing Peter Ivanovich enter he
stopped and winked at him, as if to say: “Ivan
Ilych has made a mess of things - not like you
and me.”

Schwartz's face with his Piccadilly whiskers, and
his slim figure in evening dress, had as usual an
air of elegant solemnity which contrasted with the
playfulness of his character and had a special pi-
quancy here, or so it seemed to Peter Ivanovich.

Peter Ivanovich allowed the ladies to precede him
and slowly followed them upstairs. Schwartz did
not come down but remained where he was, and
Peter Ivanovich understood that he wanted to ar-
range where they should play bridge that evening.
The ladies went upstairs to the widow's room, and
Schwartz with seriously compressed lips but a
playful looking his eyes, indicated by a twist of
his eyebrows the room to the right where the body
lay.

Peter Ivanovich, like everyone else on such occa-
sions, entered feeling uncertain what he would
have to do. All he knew was that at such times it
is always safe to cross oneself. But he was not
quite sure whether one should make obseisances
while doing so. He therefore adopted a middle
course. On entering the room he began crossing
himself and made a slight movement resembling
a bow. At the same time, as far as the motion of
his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the room.
Two young men - apparently nephews, one of
whom was a high-school pupil - were leaving the
room, crossing themselves as they did so. An old

woman was standing motionless, and a lady with
strangely arched eyebrows was saying something to
her in a whisper. A vigorous, resolute Church Reader,
in a frock-coat, was reading something in a loud
voice with an expression that precluded any contra-
diction. The butler's assistant, Gerasim, stepping
lightly in front of Peter Ivanovich, was strewing
something on the floor. Noticing this, Peter Ivanovich
was immediately aware of a faint odour of a decom-
posing body.

The last time he had called on Ivan Ilych, Peter
Ivanovich had seen Gerasim in the study. Ivan Ilych
had been particularly fond of him and he was per-
forming the duty of a sick nurse.

Peter Ivanovich continued to make the sign of the
cross slightly inclining his head in an intermediate
direction between the coffin, the Reader, and the
icons on the table in a corner of the room. After-
wards, when it seemed to him that this movement
of his arm in crossing himself had gone on too long,
he stopped and began to look at the corpse.

The dead man lay, as dead men always lie, in a
specially heavy way, his rigid limbs sunk in the soft
cushions of the coffin, with the head forever bowed
on the pillow. His yellow waxen brow with bald
patches over his sunken temples was thrust up in
the way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose

Leo Tolstoy was a Russian novelist
4 and moral philosopher noted for
be his ideas of nonviolent resistance.
His diary reveals an incessant pursuit
e of a morally justified life. He was
J known for his generosity to the
+ peasants.

 

His best known novels are “War and
Peace” (1869), which Tolstoy regarded as an epic
rather than a novel, and “Anna Karenina” (1877).
His work was admired in his time by Dostoyevsky,
Checkoy, Turgeney, and Flaubert, and later by
Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.

A masterpiece in which Tolstoy's writing prowess

reaches its zenith. It focusses on a subject close to
human life - death. The issue is introduced through
the character of a high court judge who recognizes,
after death stares him in the face, that his life has
been pointless and devoid of meaning. Moving and

insightful!
