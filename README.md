# PythonWebScraper
Guide for Python Web Scraping  
ㄴ These are my practice codes while studying a book "Web Scraping with Python <2nd ed.>" written by Ryan Mitchell, published by O'REILLY Media.  
ㄴ So, most codes are from https://github.com/REMitchell/python-scraping, but I fixed errors, removed the useless, modified, and put comments.  
  
After git clone, follow these:

  1) Enter the "PythonWebScraper" directory.  
  2) Make virtual environment:  
    - virtualenv venv  
    - venv\Scripts\activate (Or "source venv/bin/activate" in Mac)  
    - pip install -r requirements.txt  
  3) Implement any .py file you want.
