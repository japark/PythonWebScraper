,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,.,[1],[2], Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

,
,Scala, (,/,ˈ,s,k,ɑː,l,ɑː,/, ,SKAH,-lah,),[7], is a ,general-purpose programming language, providing support for both ,object-oriented programming, and ,functional programming,. The language has a strong ,static, ,type system,. Designed to be concise,,[8], many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address ,criticisms of Java,.,[6],
,Scala source code is intended to be compiled to ,Java bytecode,, so that the resulting executable code runs on a ,Java virtual machine,. Scala provides ,language interoperability, with ,Java,, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code.,[9], Like Java, Scala is ,object-oriented,, and uses a ,curly-brace syntax, reminiscent of the ,C programming language,. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of ,functional programming, languages like ,Scheme,, ,Standard ML, and ,Haskell,, including ,currying,, ,immutability,, ,lazy evaluation,, and ,pattern matching,. It also has an advanced type system supporting ,algebraic data types,, ,covariance and contravariance,, ,higher-order types, (but not ,higher-rank types,), and ,anonymous types,. Other features of Scala not present in Java include ,operator overloading,, optional parameters, ,named parameters,, and ,raw strings,. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is ,checked exceptions,, which has proved controversial.,[10],
,The name Scala is a portmanteau of ,scalable, and ,language,, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.,[11],

,History,[,edit,],
,The design of Scala started in 2001 at the ,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, (EPFL) (in ,Lausanne,, ,Switzerland,) by ,Martin Odersky,. It followed on from work on Funnel, a programming language combining ideas from functional programming and ,Petri nets,.,[12], Odersky formerly worked on ,Generic Java,, and ,javac,, Sun's Java compiler.,[12],
,After an internal release in late 2003, Scala was released publicly in early 2004 on the ,Java platform,,,[13],[6],[12],[14], A second version (v2.0) followed in March 2006.,[6],
,On 17 January 2011, the Scala team won a five-year research grant of over €2.3 million from the ,European Research Council,.,[15], On 12 May 2011, Odersky and collaborators launched Typesafe Inc. (later renamed ,Lightbend Inc.,), a company to provide commercial support, training, and services for Scala. Typesafe received a $3 million investment in 2011 from ,Greylock Partners,.,[16],[17],[18],[19],

,Scala runs on the ,Java platform, (,Java virtual machine,) and is compatible with existing ,Java, programs.,[13], As ,Android, applications are typically written in Java and translated from Java bytecode into ,Dalvik, bytecode (which may be further translated to native machine code during installation) when packaged, Scala's Java compatibility makes it well-suited to Android development, more so when a functional approach is preferred.,[20],
,The reference Scala software distribution, including compiler and libraries, is released under the ,Apache license,.,[21],
,
,Other compilers and targets,[,edit,],
,Scala.js, is a Scala compiler that compiles to JavaScript, making it possible to write Scala programs that can run in web browsers or ,Node.js,.,[22], The compiler was in development since 2013, was announced as no longer experimental in 2015 (v0.6). Version v1.0.0-M1 was released in June 2018. In September 2020 it is at version 1.1.1.,[23],
,Scala Native is a Scala ,compiler, that targets the ,LLVM, compiler infrastructure to create executable code that uses a lightweight managed runtime, which uses the ,Boehm garbage collector,. The project is led by Denys Shabalin and had its first release, 0.1, on 14 March 2017. Development of Scala Native began in 2015 with a goal of being faster than ,just-in-time compilation, for the JVM by eliminating the initial runtime compilation of code and also providing the ability to call native routines directly.,[24],[25],
,A reference Scala compiler targeting the ,.NET Framework, and its ,Common Language Runtime, was released in June 2004,,[12], but was officially dropped in 2012.,[26],
,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,""Hello World"" example,[,edit,],
,The ,Hello World program, written in Scala has this form:
,
, ,object, ,HelloWorld, ,extends, ,App, ,{,
   ,println,(,""Hello, World!"",),
 ,},
,
,Unlike the ,stand-alone Hello World application for Java,, there is no class declaration and nothing is declared to be static; a ,singleton object, created with the ,object, keyword is used instead.
,When the program is stored in file ,HelloWorld.scala,, the user compiles it with the command:
,
,$ scalac HelloWorld.scala
,
,and runs it with
,
,$ scala HelloWorld
,
,This is analogous to the process for compiling and running Java code. Indeed, Scala's compiling and executing model is identical to that of Java, making it compatible with Java build tools such as ,Apache Ant,.
,A shorter version of the ""Hello World"" Scala program is:
,
,println,(,""Hello, World!"",),
,
,Scala includes interactive shell and scripting support.,[27], Saved in a file named ,HelloWorld2.scala,, this can be run as a script with no prior compiling using:
,
,$ scala HelloWorld2.scala
,
,Commands can also be entered directly into the Scala interpreter, using the option ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},-e,:
,
,$ scala ,-e, 'println(""Hello, World!"")'
,
,Expressions can be entered interactively in the ,REPL,:

,Basic example,[,edit,],
,The following example shows the differences between Java and Scala syntax:
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,int, ,mathFunction,(,int, ,num,), ,{,
    ,int, ,numSquare, ,=, ,num,*,num,;,
    ,return, ,(,int,), ,(,Math,.,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+,
      ,Math,.,log,(,numSquare,));,
,},
,
,
,
,// Scala: Direct conversion from Java,

,// no import needed; scala.math,
,// already imported as `math`,
,def, ,mathFunction,(,num,:, ,Int,),:, ,Int, ,=, ,{,
  ,var, ,numSquare,:, ,Int, ,=, ,num,*,num,
  ,return, ,(,math,.,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+, ,math,.,log,(,numSquare,)).,
    ,asInstanceOf,[,Int,],
,},
,
,
,// Scala: More idiomatic,
,// Uses type inference, omits `return` statement,,
,// uses `toInt` method, declares numSquare immutable,

,import, ,math._,
,def, ,mathFunction,(,num,:, ,Int,), ,=, ,{,
  ,val, ,numSquare, ,=, ,num,*,num,
  ,(,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+, ,log,(,numSquare,)).,toInt,
,},
,
,
,Some syntactic differences in this code are:
,
,Scala does not require semicolons to end statements.,
,Value types are capitalized: ,Int, Double, Boolean, instead of ,int, double, boolean,.,
,Parameter and return types follow, as in ,Pascal,, rather than precede as in ,C,.,
,Methods must be preceded by ,def,.,
,Local or class variables must be preceded by ,val, (indicates an ,immutable, variable) or ,var, (indicates a ,mutable, variable).,
,The ,return, operator is unnecessary in a function (although allowed); the value of the last executed statement or expression is normally the function's value.,
,Instead of the Java cast operator ,(Type) foo,, Scala uses ,foo.asInstanceOf[Type],, or a specialized function such as ,toDouble, or ,toInt,.,
,Instead of Java's ,import foo.*;,, Scala uses ,import foo._,.,
,Function or method ,foo(), can also be called as just ,foo,; method ,thread.send(signo), can also be called as just ,thread send signo,; and method ,foo.toString(), can also be called as just ,foo toString,.,
,These syntactic relaxations are designed to allow support for ,domain-specific languages,.
,Some other basic syntactic differences:
,
,Array references are written like function calls, e.g. ,array(i), rather than ,array[i],. (Internally in Scala, the former expands into array.apply(i) which returns the reference),
,Generic types are written as e.g. ,List[String], rather than Java's ,List<String>,.,
,Instead of the pseudo-type ,void,, Scala has the actual ,singleton class, ,Unit, (see below).,
,Example with classes,[,edit,],
,The following example contrasts the definition of classes in Java and Scala.
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,public, ,class, ,Point, ,{,
  ,private, ,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,y,;,

  ,public, ,Point,(,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,final, ,double, ,y,), ,{,
    ,this,.,x, ,=, ,x,;,
    ,this,.,y, ,=, ,y,;,
  ,},

  ,public, ,Point,(,
    ,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,final, ,double, ,y,,,
    ,final, ,boolean, ,addToGrid,
  ,), ,{,
    ,this,(,x,,, ,y,);,

    ,if, ,(,addToGrid,),
      ,grid,.,add,(,this,);,
  ,},

  ,public, ,Point,(), ,{,
    ,this,(,0.0,,, ,0.0,);,
  ,},

  ,public, ,double, ,getX,(), ,{,
    ,return, ,x,;,
  ,},

  ,public, ,double, ,getY,(), ,{,
    ,return, ,y,;,
  ,},

  ,double, ,distanceToPoint,(,final, ,Point, ,other,), ,{,
    ,return, ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x,,, ,y,,,

  ,},

  ,private, ,static, ,Grid, ,grid, ,=, ,new, ,Grid,();,

      ,final, ,double, ,x1,,, ,final, ,double, ,y1,,,
      ,final, ,double, ,x2,,, ,final, ,double, ,y2,
  ,), ,{,
    ,return, ,Math,.,hypot,(,x1, ,-, ,x2,,, ,y1, ,-, ,y2,);,
  ,},
,},
,
,
,// Scala,
,class, ,Point,(,
    ,val, ,x,:, ,Double,,, ,val, ,y,:, ,Double,,,
    ,addToGrid,:, ,Boolean, ,=, ,false,
,), ,{,
  ,import, ,Point._,

  ,if, ,(,addToGrid,),
    ,grid,.,add,(,this,),

  ,def, ,this,(), ,=, ,this,(,0.0,,, ,0.0,),

  ,def, ,distanceToPoint,(,other,:, ,Point,), ,=,
    ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x,,, ,y,,, ,other,.,x,,, ,other,.,y,),
,},

  ,private, ,val, ,grid, ,=, ,new, ,Grid,(),

  ,def, ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x1,:, ,Double,,, ,y1,:, ,Double,,,
      ,x2,:, ,Double,,, ,y2,:, ,Double,), ,=, ,{,
    ,math,.,hypot,(,x1, ,-, ,x2,,, ,y1, ,-, ,y2,),
  ,},
,},
,
,
,The code above shows some of the conceptual differences between Java and Scala's handling of classes:
,
,Scala has no static variables or methods. Instead, it has ,singleton objects,, which are essentially classes with only one instance. Singleton objects are declared using ,object, instead of ,class,. It is common to place static variables and methods in a singleton object with the same name as the class name, which is then known as a ,companion object,.,[13], (The underlying class for the singleton object has a ,$, appended. Hence, for ,class Foo, with companion object ,object Foo,, under the hood there's a class ,Foo$, containing the companion object's code, and one object of this class is created, using the ,singleton pattern,.),
,In place of constructor parameters, Scala has ,class parameters,, which are placed on the class, similar to parameters to a function. When declared with a ,val, or ,var, modifier, fields are also defined with the same name, and automatically initialized from the class parameters. (Under the hood, external access to public fields always goes through accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods, which are automatically created. The accessor function has the same name as the field, which is why it's unnecessary in the above example to explicitly declare accessor methods.) Note that alternative constructors can also be declared, as in Java. Code that would go into the ,default constructor, (other than initializing the member variables) goes directly at class level.,
,Default visibility in Scala is ,public,.,
,Features (with reference to Java),[,edit,],
,Scala has the same compiling model as ,Java, and ,C#,, namely separate compiling and ,dynamic class loading,, so that Scala code can call Java libraries.
,Scala's operational characteristics are the same as Java's. The Scala compiler generates byte code that is nearly identical to that generated by the Java compiler.,[13], In fact, Scala code can be ,decompiled, to readable Java code, with the exception of certain constructor operations. To the ,Java virtual machine, (JVM), Scala code and Java code are indistinguishable. The only difference is one extra runtime library, ,scala-library.jar,.,[28],
,Scala adds a large number of features compared with Java, and has some fundamental differences in its underlying model of expressions and types, which make the language theoretically cleaner and eliminate several ,corner cases, in Java. From the Scala perspective, this is practically important because several added features in Scala are also available in C#. Examples include:
,
,Syntactic flexibility,[,edit,],
,As mentioned above, Scala has a good deal of syntactic flexibility, compared with Java. The following are some examples:
,
,Semicolons are unnecessary; lines are automatically joined if they begin or end with a token that cannot normally come in this position, or if there are unclosed parentheses or brackets.,
,Any method can be used as an infix operator, e.g. ,""%d apples"".format(num), and ,""%d apples"" format num, are equivalent. In fact, arithmetic operators like ,+, and ,<<, are treated just like any other methods, since function names are allowed to consist of sequences of arbitrary symbols (with a few exceptions made for things like parens, brackets and braces that must be handled specially); the only special treatment that such symbol-named methods undergo concerns the handling of precedence.,
,Methods ,apply, and ,update, have syntactic short forms. ,foo(),—where ,foo, is a value (singleton object or class instance)—is short for ,foo.apply(),, and ,foo() = 42, is short for ,foo.update(42),. Similarly, ,foo(42), is short for ,foo.apply(42),, and ,foo(4) = 2, is short for ,foo.update(4, 2),. This is used for collection classes and extends to many other cases, such as ,STM, cells.,
,Scala distinguishes between no-parens (,def foo = 42,) and empty-parens (,def foo() = 42,) methods. When calling an empty-parens method, the parentheses may be omitted, which is useful when calling into Java libraries that do not know this distinction, e.g., using ,foo.toString, instead of ,foo.toString(),. By convention, a method should be defined with empty-parens when it performs ,side effects,.,
,Method names ending in colon (,:,) expect the argument on the left-hand-side and the receiver on the right-hand-side. For example, the ,4 :: 2 :: Nil, is the same as ,Nil.::(2).::(4),, the first form corresponding visually to the result (a list with first element 4 and second element 2).,
,Class body variables can be transparently implemented as separate getter and setter methods. For ,trait FooLike { var bar: Int },, an implementation may be ,object, ,Foo, ,extends, ,FooLike, ,{, ,private, ,var, ,x, ,=, ,0,;, ,def, ,bar, ,=, ,x,;, ,def, ,bar_=,(,value,:, ,Int,), ,{, ,x, ,=, ,value, ,}}, ,}, ,},. The call site will still be able to use a concise ,foo.bar = 42,.,
,The use of curly braces instead of parentheses is allowed in method calls. This allows pure library implementations of new control structures.,[29], For example, ,breakable { ... if (...) break() ... }, looks as if ,breakable, was a language defined keyword, but really is just a method taking a ,thunk, argument. Methods that take thunks or functions often place these in a second parameter list, allowing to mix parentheses and curly braces syntax: ,Vector.fill(4) { math.random }, is the same as ,Vector.fill(4)(math.random),. The curly braces variant allows the expression to span multiple lines.,
,For-expressions (explained further down) can accommodate any type that defines monadic methods such as ,map,, ,flatMap, and ,filter,.,
,By themselves, these may seem like questionable choices, but collectively they serve the purpose of allowing ,domain-specific languages, to be defined in Scala without needing to extend the compiler. For example, ,Erlang,'s special syntax for sending a message to an actor, i.e. ,actor ! message, can be (and is) implemented in a Scala library without needing language extensions.
,
,Unified type system,[,edit,],
,Java makes a sharp distinction between primitive types (e.g. ,int, and ,boolean,) and reference types (any ,class,). Only reference types are part of the inheritance scheme, deriving from ,java.lang.Object,. In Scala, all types inherit from a top-level class ,Any,, whose immediate children are ,AnyVal, (value types, such as ,Int, and ,Boolean,) and ,AnyRef, (reference types, as in Java). This means that the Java distinction between primitive types and boxed types (e.g. ,int, vs. ,Integer,) is not present in Scala; boxing and unboxing is completely transparent to the user. Scala 2.10 allows for new value types to be defined by the user.
,
,For-expressions,[,edit,],
,Instead of the Java "",foreach,"" loops for looping through an iterator, Scala has ,for,-expressions, which are similar to ,list comprehensions, in languages such as Haskell, or a combination of list comprehensions and ,generator expressions, in ,Python,. For-expressions using the ,yield, keyword allow a new ,collection, to be generated by iterating over an existing one, returning a new collection of the same type. They are translated by the compiler into a series of ,map,, ,flatMap, and ,filter, calls. Where ,yield, is not used, the code approximates to an imperative-style loop, by translating to ,foreach,.
,A simple example is:
,
,val, ,s, ,=, ,for, ,(,x, ,<-, ,1, ,to, ,25, ,if, ,x,*,x, ,>, ,50,), ,yield, ,2,*,x,
,
,The result of running it is the following vector:
,
,Vector(16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50),
,(Note that the expression ,1 to 25, is not special syntax. The method ,to, is rather defined in the standard Scala library as an extension method on integers, using a technique known as implicit conversions,[30], that allows new methods to be added to existing types.)
,A more complex example of iterating over a map is:
,
,// Given a map specifying Twitter users mentioned in a set of tweets,,
,// and number of times each user was mentioned, look up the users,
,// in a map of known politicians, and return a new map giving only the,
,// Democratic politicians (as objects, rather than strings).,
,val, ,dem_mentions, ,=, ,for, ,{,
    ,(,mention,,, ,times,), ,<-, ,mentions,
    ,account,          ,<-, ,accounts,.,get,(,mention,),
    ,if, ,account,.,party, ,==, ,""Democratic"",
  ,}, ,yield, ,(,account,,, ,times,),
,
,Expression ,(mention, times) <- mentions, is an example of ,pattern matching, (see below). Iterating over a map returns a set of key-value ,tuples,, and pattern-matching allows the tuples to easily be destructured into separate variables for the key and value. Similarly, the result of the comprehension also returns key-value tuples, which are automatically built back up into a map because the source object (from the variable ,mentions,) is a map. Note that if ,mentions, instead held a list, set, array or other collection of tuples, exactly the same code above would yield a new collection of the same type.
,
,Functional tendencies,[,edit,],
,While supporting all of the object-oriented features available in Java (and in fact, augmenting them in various ways), Scala also provides a large number of capabilities that are normally found only in ,functional programming, languages. Together, these features allow Scala programs to be written in an almost completely functional style and also allow functional and object-oriented styles to be mixed.
,Examples are:
,
,No distinction between statements and expressions,
,Type inference,
,Anonymous functions, with capturing semantics (i.e., ,closures,),
,Immutable variables and objects,
,Lazy evaluation,
,Delimited continuations, (since 2.8),

,Unlike C or Java, but similar to languages such as ,Lisp,, Scala makes no distinction between statements and expressions. All statements are in fact expressions that evaluate to some value. Functions that would be declared as returning ,void, in C or Java, and statements like ,while, that logically do not return a value, are in Scala considered to return the type ,Unit,, which is a ,singleton type,, with only one object of that type. Functions and operators that never return at all (e.g. the ,throw, operator or a function that always exits ,non-locally, using an exception) logically have return type ,Nothing,, a special type containing no objects; that is, a ,bottom type,, i.e. a subclass of every possible type. (This in turn makes type ,Nothing, compatible with every type, allowing ,type inference, to function correctly.)
,Similarly, an ,if-then-else, ""statement"" is actually an expression, which produces a value, i.e. the result of evaluating one of the two branches. This means that such a block of code can be inserted wherever an expression is desired, obviating the need for a ,ternary operator, in Scala:
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,int, ,hexDigit, ,=, ,x, ,>=, ,10, ,?, ,x, ,+, ,'A', ,-, ,10, ,:, ,x, ,+, ,'0',;,
,
,
,// Scala:,
,val, ,hexDigit, ,=, ,if, ,(,x, ,>=, ,10,), ,x, ,+, ,'A', ,-, ,10, ,else, ,x, ,+, ,'0',
,
,
,For similar reasons, ,return, statements are unnecessary in Scala, and in fact are discouraged. As in Lisp, the last expression in a block of code is the value of that block of code, and if the block of code is the body of a function, it will be returned by the function.
,To make it clear that all functions are expressions, even methods that return ,Unit, are written with an equals sign
,
,def, ,printValue,(,x,:, ,String,),:, ,Unit, ,=, ,{,
  ,println,(,""I ate a %s"",.,format,(,x,)),
,},
,
,or equivalently (with type inference, and omitting the unnecessary braces):
,
,def, ,printValue,(,x,:, ,String,), ,=, ,println,(,""I ate a %s"", ,format, ,x,),
,
,Type inference,[,edit,],
,Due to ,type inference,, the type of variables, function return values, and many other expressions can typically be omitted, as the compiler can deduce it. Examples are ,val x = ""foo"", (for an immutable ,constant, or ,immutable object,) or ,var x = 1.5, (for a variable whose value can later be changed). Type inference in Scala is essentially local, in contrast to the more global ,Hindley-Milner, algorithm used in ,Haskell,, ,ML, and other more purely functional languages. This is done to facilitate object-oriented programming. The result is that certain types still need to be declared (most notably, function parameters, and the return types of ,recursive functions,), e.g.
,
,def, ,formatApples,(,x,:, ,Int,), ,=, ,""I ate %d apples"",.,format,(,x,),
,
,or (with a return type declared for a recursive function)
,
,def, ,factorial,(,x,:, ,Int,),:, ,Int, ,=,
  ,if, ,(,x, ,==, ,0,),
    ,1,
  ,else,
    ,x,*,factorial,(,x, ,-, ,1,),
,
,Anonymous functions,[,edit,],
,In Scala, functions are objects, and a convenient syntax exists for specifying ,anonymous functions,. An example is the expression ,x => x < 2,, which specifies a function with one parameter, that compares its argument to see if it is less than 2. It is equivalent to the Lisp form ,(lambda (x) (< x 2)),. Note that neither the type of ,x, nor the return type need be explicitly specified, and can generally be inferred by ,type inference,; but they can be explicitly specified, e.g. as ,(x: Int) => x < 2, or even ,(x: Int) => (x < 2): Boolean,.
,Anonymous functions behave as true ,closures, in that they automatically capture any variables that are lexically available in the environment of the enclosing function. Those variables will be available even after the enclosing function returns, and unlike in the case of Java's ,anonymous inner classes, do not need to be declared as final. (It is even possible to modify such variables if they are mutable, and the modified value will be available the next time the anonymous function is called.)
,An even shorter form of anonymous function uses ,placeholder, variables: For example, the following:
,
,list map { x => sqrt(x) },
,can be written more concisely as
,
,list map { sqrt(_) },
,or even
,
,list map sqrt,
,Immutability,[,edit,],
,Scala enforces a distinction between immutable and mutable variables. Mutable variables are declared using the ,var, keyword and immutable values are declared using the ,val, keyword.
A variable declared using the ,val, keyword can not be reassigned in the same way that a variable declared using the ,final, keyword can't be reassigned in Java. It should be noted however that ,val,'s are only shallowly immutable, that is, an object referenced by a val is not guaranteed to itself be immutable.
,Immutable classes are encouraged by convention however, and the Scala standard library provides a rich set of immutable ,collection, classes.
Scala provides mutable and immutable variants of most collection classes, and the immutable version is always used unless the mutable version is explicitly imported.,[31],
The immutable variants are ,persistent data structures, that always return an updated copy of an old object instead of updating the old object destructively in place.
An example of this is ,immutable linked lists, where prepending an element to a list is done by returning a new list node consisting of the element and a reference to the list tail.
Appending an element to a list can only be done by prepending all elements in the old list to a new list with only the new element.
In the same way, inserting an element in the middle of a list will copy the first half of the list, but keep a reference to the second half of the list. This is called structural sharing.
This allows for very easy concurrency — no locks are needed as no shared objects are ever modified.,[32],
,
,Lazy (non-strict) evaluation,[,edit,],
,Evaluation is strict (""eager"") by default. In other words, Scala evaluates expressions as soon as they are available, rather than as needed. However, it is possible to declare a variable non-strict (""lazy"") with the ,lazy, keyword, meaning that the code to produce the variable's value will not be evaluated until the first time the variable is referenced. Non-strict collections of various types also exist (such as the type ,Stream,, a non-strict linked list), and any collection can be made non-strict with the ,view, method. Non-strict collections provide a good semantic fit to things like server-produced data, where the evaluation of the code to generate later elements of a list (that in turn triggers a request to a server, possibly located somewhere else on the web) only happens when the elements are actually needed.
,
,Tail recursion,[,edit,],
,Functional programming languages commonly provide ,tail call, optimization to allow for extensive use of ,recursion, without ,stack overflow, problems. Limitations in Java bytecode complicate tail call optimization on the JVM. In general, a function that calls itself with a tail call can be optimized, but mutually recursive functions cannot. ,Trampolines, have been suggested as a workaround.,[33], Trampoline support has been provided by the Scala library with the object ,scala.util.control.TailCalls, since Scala 2.8.0 (released 14 July 2010). A function may optionally be annotated with ,@tailrec,, in which case it will not compile unless it is tail recursive.,[34],
,
,Case classes and pattern matching,[,edit,],
,Scala has built-in support for ,pattern matching,, which can be thought of as a more sophisticated, extensible version of a ,switch statement,, where arbitrary data types can be matched (rather than just simple types like integers, booleans and strings), including arbitrary nesting. A special type of class known as a ,case class, is provided, which includes automatic support for pattern matching and can be used to model the ,algebraic data types, used in many functional programming languages. (From the perspective of Scala, a case class is simply a normal class for which the compiler automatically adds certain behaviors that could also be provided manually, e.g., definitions of methods providing for deep comparisons and hashing, and destructuring a case class on its constructor parameters during pattern matching.)
,An example of a definition of the ,quicksort, algorithm using pattern matching is this:
,
,def, ,qsort,(,list,:, ,List,[,Int,]),:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,list, ,match, ,{,
  ,case, ,Nil, ,=>, ,Nil,
  ,case, ,pivot, ,::, ,tail, ,=>,
    ,val, ,(,smaller,,, ,rest,), ,=, ,tail,.,partition,(,_, ,<, ,pivot,),
    ,qsort,(,smaller,), ,:::, ,pivot, ,::, ,qsort,(,rest,),
,},
,
,The idea here is that we partition a list into the elements less than a pivot and the elements not less, recursively sort each part, and paste the results together with the pivot in between. This uses the same ,divide-and-conquer, strategy of ,mergesort, and other fast sorting algorithms.
,The ,match, operator is used to do pattern matching on the object stored in ,list,. Each ,case, expression is tried in turn to see if it will match, and the first match determines the result. In this case, ,Nil, only matches the literal object ,Nil,, but ,pivot :: tail, matches a non-empty list, and simultaneously ,destructures, the list according to the pattern given. In this case, the associated code will have access to a local variable named ,pivot, holding the head of the list, and another variable ,tail, holding the tail of the list. Note that these variables are read-only, and are semantically very similar to variable ,bindings, established using the ,let, operator in Lisp and Scheme.
,Pattern matching also happens in local variable declarations. In this case, the return value of the call to ,tail.partition, is a ,tuple, — in this case, two lists. (Tuples differ from other types of containers, e.g. lists, in that they are always of fixed size and the elements can be of differing types — although here they are both the same.) Pattern matching is the easiest way of fetching the two parts of the tuple.
,The form ,_ < pivot, is a declaration of an ,anonymous function, with a placeholder variable; see the section above on anonymous functions.
,The list operators ,::, (which adds an element onto the beginning of a list, similar to ,cons, in Lisp and Scheme) and ,:::, (which appends two lists together, similar to ,append, in Lisp and Scheme) both appear. Despite appearances, there is nothing ""built-in"" about either of these operators. As specified above, any string of symbols can serve as function name, and a method applied to an object can be written "",infix,""-style without the period or parentheses. The line above as written:
,
,qsort(smaller) ::: pivot :: qsort(rest),
,could also be written thus:
,
,qsort(rest).::(pivot).:::(qsort(smaller)),
,in more standard method-call notation. (Methods that end with a colon are right-associative and bind to the object to the right.)

,In the pattern-matching example above, the body of the ,match, operator is a ,partial function,, which consists of a series of ,case, expressions, with the first matching expression prevailing, similar to the body of a ,switch statement,. Partial functions are also used in the exception-handling portion of a ,try, statement:
,
,try, ,{,
  ,...,
,}, ,catch, ,{,
  ,case, ,nfe,:,NumberFormatException, ,=>, ,{, ,println,(,nfe,);, ,List,(,0,), ,},
  ,case, ,_, ,=>, ,Nil,
,},
,
,Finally, a partial function can be used alone, and the result of calling it is equivalent to doing a ,match, over it. For example, the prior code for ,quicksort, can be written thus:
,
,val, ,qsort,:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=>, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,{,
  ,case, ,Nil, ,=>, ,Nil,
  ,case, ,pivot, ,::, ,tail, ,=>,
    ,val, ,(,smaller,,, ,rest,), ,=, ,tail,.,partition,(,_, ,<, ,pivot,),
    ,qsort,(,smaller,), ,:::, ,pivot, ,::, ,qsort,(,rest,),
,},
,
,Here a read-only ,variable, is declared whose type is a function from lists of integers to lists of integers, and bind it to a partial function. (Note that the single parameter of the partial function is never explicitly declared or named.) However, we can still call this variable exactly as if it were a normal function:
,
,scala,>, ,qsort,(,List,(,6,,,2,,,5,,,9,)),
,res32,:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,List,(,2,,, ,5,,, ,6,,, ,9,),
,
,Object-oriented extensions,[,edit,],
,Scala is a pure ,object-oriented language, in the sense that every value is an ,object,. ,Data types, and behaviors of objects are described by ,classes, and ,traits,. Class abstractions are extended by ,subclassing, and by a flexible ,mixin,-based composition mechanism to avoid the problems of ,multiple inheritance,.
,Traits are Scala's replacement for Java's ,interfaces,. Interfaces in Java versions under 8 are highly restricted, able only to contain abstract function declarations. This has led to criticism that providing convenience methods in interfaces is awkward (the same methods must be reimplemented in every implementation), and extending a published interface in a backwards-compatible way is impossible. Traits are similar to ,mixin, classes in that they have nearly all the power of a regular abstract class, lacking only class parameters (Scala's equivalent to Java's constructor parameters), since traits are always mixed in with a class. The ,super, operator behaves specially in traits, allowing traits to be chained using composition in addition to inheritance. The following example is a simple window system:
,
,abstract, ,class, ,Window, ,{,
  ,// abstract,
  ,def, ,draw,(),
,},

,class, ,SimpleWindow, ,extends, ,Window, ,{,
  ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in SimpleWindow"",),
    ,// draw a basic window,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,WindowDecoration, ,extends, ,Window, ,{, ,},

,trait, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,// ""abstract override"" is needed here in order for ""super()"" to work because the parent,
  ,// function is abstract. If it were concrete, regular ""override"" would be enough.,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in HorizontalScrollbarDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw a horizontal scrollbar,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in VerticalScrollbarDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw a vertical scrollbar,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,TitleDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in TitleDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw the title bar,
  ,},
,},
,
,A variable may be declared thus:
,
,val, ,mywin, ,=, ,new, ,SimpleWindow, ,with, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration, ,with, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration, ,with, ,TitleDecoration,
,
,The result of calling ,mywin.draw(), is:
,
,in, ,TitleDecoration,
,in, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration,
,in, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration,
,in, ,SimpleWindow,
,
,In other words, the call to ,draw, first executed the code in ,TitleDecoration, (the last trait mixed in), then (through the ,super(), calls) threaded back through the other mixed-in traits and eventually to the code in ,Window,, ,even though none of the traits inherited from one another,. This is similar to the ,decorator pattern,, but is more concise and less error-prone, as it doesn't require explicitly encapsulating the parent window, explicitly forwarding functions whose implementation isn't changed, or relying on run-time initialization of entity relationships. In other languages, a similar effect could be achieved at compile-time with a long linear chain of ,implementation inheritance,, but with the disadvantage compared to Scala that one linear inheritance chain would have to be declared for each possible combination of the mix-ins.
,
,Expressive type system,[,edit,],
,Scala is equipped with an expressive static type system that mostly enforces the safe and coherent use of abstractions. The type system is, however, not ,sound,.,[35], In particular, the type system supports:
,
,Classes, and ,abstract types, as object members,
,Structural types,
,Path-dependent types,
,Compound types,
,Explicitly typed self references,
,Generic classes,
,Polymorphic, methods,
,Upper and lower type bounds,
,Variance,
,Annotation,
,Views,
,Scala is able to ,infer types, by usage. This makes most static type declarations optional. Static types need not be explicitly declared unless a compiler error indicates the need. In practice, some static type declarations are included for the sake of code clarity.
,
,Type enrichment,[,edit,],
,A common technique in Scala, known as ""enrich my library"",[36], (originally termed ""pimp my library"" by Martin Odersky in 2006;,[30], concerns were raised about this phrasing due to its negative connotations,[37], and immaturity,[38],), allows new methods to be used as if they were added to existing types. This is similar to the C# concept of ,extension methods, but more powerful, because the technique is not limited to adding methods and can, for instance, be used to implement new interfaces. In Scala, this technique involves declaring an ,implicit conversion, from the type ""receiving"" the method to a new type (typically, a class) that wraps the original type and provides the additional method. If a method cannot be found for a given type, the compiler automatically searches for any applicable implicit conversions to types that provide the method in question.
,This technique allows new methods to be added to an existing class using an add-on library such that only code that ,imports, the add-on library gets the new functionality, and all other code is unaffected.
,The following example shows the enrichment of type ,Int, with methods ,isEven, and ,isOdd,:
,
,object, ,MyExtensions, ,{,
  ,implicit, ,class, ,IntPredicates,(,i,:, ,Int,), ,{,
    ,def, ,isEven, ,=, ,i, ,%, ,2, ,==, ,0,
    ,def, ,isOdd,  ,=, ,!,isEven,
  ,},
,},

,import, ,MyExtensions._,  ,// bring implicit enrichment into scope,
,4.,isEven,  ,// -> true,
,
,Importing the members of ,MyExtensions, brings the implicit conversion to extension class ,IntPredicates, into scope.,[39],
,
,Concurrency,[,edit,],
,Scala's standard library includes support for the ,actor model,, in addition to the standard Java concurrency APIs. ,Lightbend Inc., provides a platform,[40], that includes ,Akka,,,[41], a separate open-source framework that provides actor-based concurrency. Akka actors may be ,distributed, or combined with ,software transactional memory, (,transactors,). Alternative ,communicating sequential processes, (CSP) implementations for channel-based message passing are Communicating Scala Objects,,[42], or simply via ,JCSP,.
,An Actor is like a thread instance with a mailbox. It can be created by ,system.actorOf,, overriding the ,receive, method to receive messages and using the ,!, (exclamation point) method to send a message.,[43],
The following example shows an EchoServer that can receive messages and then print them.
,
,val, ,echoServer, ,=, ,actor,(,new, ,Act, ,{,
  ,become, ,{,
    ,case, ,msg, ,=>, ,println,(,""echo "", ,+, ,msg,),
  ,},
,}),
,echoServer, ,!, ,""hi"",
,
,Scala also comes with built-in support for data-parallel programming in the form of Parallel Collections,[44], integrated into its Standard Library since version 2.9.0.
,The following example shows how to use Parallel Collections to improve performance.,[45],
,
,val, ,urls, ,=, ,List,(,""https://scala-lang.org"",,, ,""https://github.com/scala/scala"",),

,def, ,fromURL,(,url,:, ,String,), ,=, ,scala,.,io,.,Source,.,fromURL,(,url,),
  ,.,getLines,().,mkString,(,""\n"",),

,val, ,t, ,=, ,System,.,currentTimeMillis,(),
,urls,.,par,.,map,(,fromURL,(,_,)), ,// par returns parallel implementation of a collection,
,println,(,""time: "", ,+, ,(,System,.,currentTimeMillis, ,-, ,t,), ,+, ,""ms"",),
,
,Besides actor support and data-parallelism, Scala also supports asynchronous programming with Futures and Promises, software transactional memory, and event streams.,[46],
,
,Cluster computing,[,edit,],
,The most well-known open-source cluster-computing solution written in Scala is ,Apache Spark,. Additionally, ,Apache Kafka,, the ,publish–subscribe, ,message queue, popular with Spark and other stream processing technologies, is written in Scala.
,
,Testing,[,edit,],
,There are several ways to test code in Scala. ,ScalaTest, supports multiple testing styles and can integrate with Java-based testing frameworks.,[47], ,ScalaCheck, is a library similar to Haskell's ,QuickCheck,.,[48], ,specs2, is a library for writing executable software specifications.,[49], ,ScalaMock, provides support for testing high-order and curried functions.,[50], ,JUnit, and ,TestNG, are popular testing frameworks written in Java.

,Comparison with other JVM languages,[,edit,],
,Scala is often compared with ,Groovy, and ,Clojure,, two other programming languages also using the JVM. Substantial differences between these languages are found in the type system, in the extent to which each language supports object-oriented and functional programming, and in the similarity of their syntax to the syntax of Java.
,Scala is ,statically typed,, while both Groovy and Clojure are ,dynamically typed,. This makes the type system more complex and difficult to understand but allows almost all,[35], type errors to be caught at compile-time and can result in significantly faster execution. By contrast, dynamic typing requires more testing to ensure program correctness and is generally slower in order to allow greater programming flexibility and simplicity. Regarding speed differences, current versions of Groovy and Clojure allow for optional type annotations to help programs avoid the overhead of dynamic typing in cases where types are practically static. This overhead is further reduced when using recent versions of the JVM, which has been enhanced with an ,invoke dynamic, instruction for methods that are defined with dynamically typed arguments. These advances reduce the speed gap between static and dynamic typing, although a statically typed language, like Scala, is still the preferred choice when execution efficiency is very important.
,Regarding programming paradigms, Scala inherits the object-oriented model of Java and extends it in various ways. Groovy, while also strongly object-oriented, is more focused in reducing verbosity. In Clojure, object-oriented programming is deemphasised with functional programming being the main strength of the language. Scala also has many functional programming facilities, including features found in advanced functional languages like ,Haskell,, and tries to be agnostic between the two paradigms, letting the developer choose between the two paradigms or, more frequently, some combination thereof.
,Regarding syntax similarity with Java, Scala inherits much of Java's syntax, as is the case with Groovy. Clojure on the other hand follows the ,Lisp, syntax, which is different in both appearance and philosophy. However, learning Scala is also considered difficult because of its many advanced features. This is not the case with Groovy, despite its also being a feature-rich language, mainly because it was designed to be mainly a scripting language.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Adoption,[,edit,],
,Language rankings,[,edit,],
,As of 2013,[update],, all JVM-based languages (Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, Scala) are significantly less popular than the original Java language, which is usually ranked first or second,,[95],[96], and which is also simultaneously evolving over time.
,The Popularity of Programming Language Index,,[97], which tracks searches for language tutorials, ranked Scala 15th in April 2018 with a small downward trend. This makes Scala the most popular JVM-based language after Java, although immediately followed by ,Kotlin,, a JVM-based language with a strong upward trend ranked 16th.
,The ,TIOBE index,[96], of programming language popularity employs internet search engine rankings and similar publication-counting to determine language popularity. As of April 2018, it shows Scala in 34th place, having dropped four places over the last two years, but–as mentioned under ""Bugs & Change Requests""–TIOBE is aware of issues with its methodology of using search terms which might not be commonly used in some programming language communities. In this ranking Scala is ahead of some functional languages like ,Haskell, (42nd), ,Erlang,, but below other languages like ,Swift, (15th), ,Perl, (16th), ,Go, (19th) and ,Clojure, (30th).
,The ,ThoughtWorks, Technology Radar, which is an opinion based biannual report of a group of senior technologists,,[98], recommended Scala adoption in its languages and frameworks category in 2013.,[99], In July 2014, this assessment was made more specific and now refers to a ""Scala, the good parts"", which is described as ""To successfully use Scala, you need to research the language and have a very strong opinion on which parts are right for you, creating your own definition of Scala, the good parts."".,[100],
,The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings, which establishes rankings based on the number of ,GitHub, projects and questions asked on ,Stack Overflow,, ranks Scala 14th.,[95], Here, Scala is placed inside a second-tier group of languages–ahead of ,Go,, ,PowerShell, and ,Haskell,, and behind ,Swift,, ,Objective-C,, ,Typescript, and ,R,. However, in its 2018 report, the Rankings noted a drop of Scala's rank for the third time in a row, questioning ""how much of the available oxygen for Scala is consumed by Kotlin as the latter continues to rocket up these rankings"".,[95],
,In the 2018 edition of the ""State of Java"" survey,,[101], which collected data from 5160 developers on various Java-related topics, Scala places third in terms of usage of alternative languages on the JVM. Compared to the last year's edition of the survey, Scala's usage among alternative JVM languages fell by almost a quarter (from 28.4% to 21.5%), overtaken by Kotlin, which rose from 11.4% in 2017 to 28.8% in 2018.

,^, ,Implicit classes were introduced in Scala 2.10 to make method extensions more concise. This is equivalent to adding a method ,implicit def IntPredicate(i: Int) = new IntPredicate(i),. The class can also be defined as ,implicit class IntPredicates(val i: Int) extends AnyVal { ... },, producing a so-called ,value class,, also introduced in Scala 2.10. The compiler will then eliminate actual instantiations and generate static methods instead, allowing extension methods to have virtually no performance overhead.,

,Ton Roosendaal, (,Dutch: ,[tɔn ˈroːsɛnˌdaːl],; born 20 March 1960,[1],) is a ,Dutch, ,software developer, and ,film producer,. He is known as the original creator of the ,open-source, ,3D, creation suite ,Blender, and ,Traces, (an ,Amiga, ray tracer which was the forerunner of Blender). He is also known as the founder and chairman of the ,Blender Foundation,, and for pioneering large scale open-content projects. In 2007, he established the Blender Institute in Amsterdam, where he works on coordinating Blender development, publishing manuals and DVD training, and organizing 3D animation and game projects.

,Early years,[,edit,],
,Roosendaal studied Industrial Design in Eindhoven, before founding the animation studio ""NeoGeo"" in 1989. It quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands.,[2], At NeoGeo, Roosendaal was responsible for software development, in 1989 he wrote a ray tracer called ,Traces, for ,Amiga, and in 1995 he decided to start the development of an in-house software tool for 3D animation, based on the Traces and tools that NeoGeo had already written. This tool was later named ""Blender"". In January 1998, a free version of Blender was released on the internet, followed by versions for Linux and FreeBSD in April.,[3], Shortly after that, NeoGeo was taken over by another company in parts. This was when Ton Roosendaal and Frank van Beek decided to found a company called Not a Number (NaN) to further market and develop Blender.,[2], NaN's business model involved providing commercial products and services around Blender. In 2000 the company secured growth financing,[4], by several investment companies. The target of this was to create a free creation tool for interactive 3D (online) content, and commercial versions of the software for distribution and publishing.,[5], Roosendaal moved to Amsterdam in 2002.,[6],
,Due to low sales and the ongoing difficult economic climate, the NaN investors decided to shut down all operations in January/February 2002, signalling the end of Blender development. However, in May 2002, with support from the community of users, and Blender customers, Ton Roosendaal founded the non-profit Blender Foundation.,[6],
,
,Blender Foundation,[,edit,],
,  ,Roosendaal at the ,Big Buck Bunny, premiere in 2008,
,The ,Blender Foundation,'s first goal was to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community based open source project. In July 2002, NaN investors agreed on a plan to attempt to publish Blender under an ,open-source license, using the ,Street Performer Protocol,.,[7], The ""Free Blender"" campaign sought to raise 100,000 EUR as a one-time fee so that the NaN investors would agree on open sourcing Blender. The campaign reached this goal in only seven weeks. On Sunday 13 October 2002, Blender was therefore released under the terms of the ,GNU General Public License,. After this success, Ton Roosendaal began to coordinate the development of Blender by volunteers as chairman of the ,Blender Foundation,.,[8],
,With Blender originating as an in-house creation tool, feedback from the use of the tool has fed into its ongoing development. In the first two and a half years of open source development, it was especially this unique attribute of the Blender project that has proved to be difficult to organize and maintain. Instead of funding the project directly by bringing together software developers, the Blender Foundation decided to start a project with the best artists within the Blender community and challenge them to make a 3D animated movie short. The goal of the project was to simultaneously prove that Blender can be used to create a professional quality animation, and to help the development of Blender itself.,[6],
,On 16 July 2009, Roosendaal was awarded an honorary doctorate in Technology at the ,Leeds Metropolitan University, for his work on Blender.,[9],[10],
,On 2 February 2019, Ton Roosendaal and the ,Blender Open Source Software, received the ,Ub Iwerks, Award at the 46th Annual ,Annie Awards, from juried.,[11],[12],
,
,Open-content projects,[,edit,],
,In 2005, work on Project Orange began. The result of the project was the world's first widely recognized open movie, ,Elephants Dream,. The movie and all assets used during production were published under the open ,Creative Commons Attribution, license.
,Because of the success of the first open movie project, Ton Roosendaal established the "",Blender Institute,"" in summer 2007.,[6], It is now the permanent office and studio of the Blender Foundation, and is mainly used as an office for the full-time employees of the Blender Foundation and to coordinate and realize the Open Projects related to 3D movies, games and visual effects.,[13],
,In April 2008 Project Peach, the open movie ,Big Buck Bunny,, was completed in the Blender Institute. In September 2008 the open game ,Yo Frankie!, was released.
The third open movie, Project Durian, also known as ,Sintel, was released on 30 September 2010.  On 10 January 2011 he announced,[14],[15], a fourth project, titled ,Tears of Steel,, released in 2012, and Project Gooseberry, entitled ,Cosmos Laundromat,, released in Summer 2015.

,OpenBSD, is a ,security-focused,, ,free and open-source,, ,Unix-like, ,operating system, based on the ,Berkeley Software Distribution, (BSD). ,Theo de Raadt, created OpenBSD in 1995 by ,forking, ,NetBSD,. According to de Raadt, OpenBSD is a ,research, operating system for developing ,security, mitigations.,[4],
,The OpenBSD project maintains ,portable, versions of many subsystems as ,packages, for other operating systems. Because of the project's emphasis on ,code quality,, many components are reused in other software projects. ,Android, uses a lot of its ,C standard library,,,[5], ,LLVM, uses its ,regular expression, library,,[6], and ,Windows 10, uses ,OpenSSH, (aka OpenBSD Secure Shell) with ,LibreSSL,.,[7],
,The word ""open"" in the name OpenBSD refers to the availability of the operating system's ,source code, on the ,Internet,, although the word ""open"" in the name OpenSSH means ""OpenBSD"". It also refers to the wide range of ,hardware platforms, the system supports.,[8],

,History,[,edit,],
,See also: ,OpenBSD version history,
,  ,Bar chart, showing the proportion of users of each ,BSD, variant from a 2005 BSD usage survey.,[9],[n 1],
,In December 1994, ,Theo de Raadt, was forced to resign from the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source repository was revoked. Fellow team members claimed it was due to personality clashes on the ,mailing lists,.,[10],
,In October 1995, De Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed by OpenBSD 2.0 in October of the same year.,[11], Since then, the project has issued a release every six months, each of which is supported for one year.
,On 25 July 2007, OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the ,OpenBSD Foundation,, a Canadian non-profit organization formed to ""act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD."",[12],
,It is hard to determine how widely OpenBSD is used, because the developers do not publish or collect usage statistics. In September 2005, the BSD Certification Group surveyed BSD users, showing that 33 percent used OpenBSD,,[9], behind ,FreeBSD, with 77 percent and ahead of NetBSD with 16 percent.,[n 1],
,
,Uses,[,edit,],
,  ,OpenBSD startup in console mode,
,  ,OpenBSD console login and welcome message,
,Network appliances,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD features a robust ,TCP/IP, ,networking, stack, and can be used as a ,router,[13], or ,wireless access point,.,[14], OpenBSD's ,security enhancements,, built-in ,cryptography,, and ,packet filter, make it suitable for security purposes such as ,firewalls,,,[15], ,intrusion-detection systems,, and ,VPN, ,gateways,.
,Several ,proprietary, systems are based on OpenBSD, including devices from ,Armorlogic, (Profense web application firewall), Calyptix Security,,[16], GeNUA,,[17], RTMX,,[18], and .vantronix.,[19],
,
,Foreign operating systems,[,edit,],
,Some versions of ,Microsoft,'s ,Services for UNIX,, an extension to the ,Windows, operating system to provide Unix-like functionality, use much OpenBSD code included in the ,Interix, interoperability suite,,[20],[21], developed by Softway Systems Inc., which Microsoft acquired in 1999.,[22],[23], Core Force, a security product for Windows, is based on OpenBSD's ,pf firewall,.,[24],
,
,Personal computers,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD ships with ,Xenocara,,,[25], an implementation of the ,X Window System,, and is suitable as a desktop operating system for ,personal computers,, including laptops.,[26],[27],:,xl, As of September 2018,[update],, OpenBSD includes approximately 8000 packages in its ,software repository,,,[28], including desktop environments such as ,GNOME,, ,Plasma 4,, and ,Xfce,, and web browsers such as ,Firefox, and ,Chromium,.,[29], The project also includes three window managers in the main distribution: ,cwm,, ,FVWM, (part of the default configuration for Xenocara), and ,twm,.,[30],
,
,Servers,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD features a full ,server, suite and can be configured as a ,mail server,, ,web server,, ,FTP server,, ,DNS server,, ,router,, ,firewall,, ,NFS, ,file server,, or any combination of these.
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,See also: ,OpenBSD security features,
,Shortly after OpenBSD was created, De Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks (later acquired by ,McAfee,).,[31],[32], They were developing a ,network security, auditing tool called Ballista,,[n 2], which was intended to find and ,exploit, software security flaws. This coincided with De Raadt's interest in security, so the two cooperated leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2.3.,[33], This collaboration helped to define security as the focus of the OpenBSD project.,[34],
,OpenBSD includes numerous features designed to improve security, such as:
,
,Secure alternatives to ,POSIX, functions in the C standard library, such as ,strlcat, for ,strcat, and ,strlcpy, for ,strcpy,[35],
,Toolchain alterations, including a ,static bounds checker,[36],
,Memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses, such as ,ProPolice, and the ,W^X, ,page, protection feature,
,Strong ,cryptography, and ,randomization,[37],
,System call, and ,filesystem, access restrictions to limit process capabilities,[4],
,To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing ,privilege escalation,, many programs have been written or adapted to make use of ,privilege separation,, ,privilege revocation, and ,chrooting,. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the ,principle of least privilege,, where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege.,[38], Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the ,file system,, prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these enhancements to OpenBSD versions of many common applications, such as ,tcpdump,, ,file,, ,tmux,, ,smtpd,, and ,syslogd,.,[39],
,OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the creation and development of ,OpenSSH, (aka OpenBSD Secure Shell), which is developed in the OpenBSD CVS repositories. OpenBSD Secure Shell is based on the original ,SSH,.,[40], It first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6 and is now by far the most popular SSH client and server, available on many operating systems.,[41],
,The project has a policy of continually auditing source code for problems, work that developer Marc Espie has described as ""never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted."" He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found, including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues, ""try[ing] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended"", and investigating whether ""it's possible to augment the ,compiler, to warn against this specific problem."",[42],
,
,Security record,[,edit,],
,The OpenBSD website features a prominent reference to the system's security record. Until June 2002, it read:
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},Five years without a remote hole in the default install!,
,In June 2002, Mark Dowd of ,Internet Security Systems, disclosed a bug in the OpenSSH code implementing ,challenge-response, ,authentication,.,[43], This ,vulnerability, in the OpenBSD default installation allowed an attacker remote access to the ,root, account, which was extremely serious not only to OpenBSD, but also to the large number of other operating systems that were using OpenSSH by that time.,[44], This problem necessitated the adjustment of the slogan on the OpenBSD website to:
,
,One remote hole in the default install, in nearly 6 years!,
,The quote remained unchanged as time passed, until on March 13, 2007, when Alfredo Ortega of Core Security Technologies,[45], disclosed a network-related remote vulnerability.,[46], The quote was subsequently changed to:
,
,Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!,
,This statement has been criticized because the default install contains few running services, and many use cases require additional services.,[47], Also, because the ports tree contains unaudited ,third-party software,, it is easy for users to compromise security by installing or improperly configuring packages. However, the project maintains that the slogan is ,intended, to refer to a default install and that it is correct by that measure.
,One of the fundamental ideas behind OpenBSD is a drive for systems to be simple, clean, and ,secure by default,. The default install is quite minimal, which the project states is to ensure novice users ""do not need to become security experts overnight"",,[48], which fits with open-source and ,code auditing, practices considered important elements of a security system.,[49],
,
,Alleged backdoor,[,edit,],
,On 11 December 2010, Gregory Perry, a former technical consultant for the ,Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI), emailed De Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex-developers 10 years prior to insert backdoors into the ,OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework,. De Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the openbsd-tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the ,IPsec, codebase.,[50],[51], De Raadt's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code. In the weeks that followed, bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors was found.,[52], De Raadt stated ""I believe that NetSec was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. If those were written, I don't believe they made it into our tree. They might have been deployed as their own product."",[53],
,
,Criticisms,[,edit,],
,In December 2017, Ilja van Sprundel, director at ,IOActive,, gave a talk at the ,CCC,[54], as well as ,DEF CON,[55],, entitled ""Are all BSDs created equally? — A survey of BSD kernel vulnerabilities."", in which he stated that although OpenBSD was the clear winner of the BSDs in terms of security, ""Bugs are still easy to find in those kernels, even in OpenBSD"".
,Two years later, in 2019, a talk named ""A systematic evaluation of OpenBSD’s mitigations"" was given,[56], at the CCC, arguing that while OpenBSD has some effective mitigations, a significant part of them are ""useless at best and based on pure luck and superstition"", arguing for a more rational approach when it comes to designing them.,[57],
,
,Hardware compatibility,[,edit,],
,Supported platforms and devices are listed in the OpenBSD Supported Platforms Notes.,[58], Other configurations may also work, but simply have not been tested or documented yet. Rough automatically extracted lists of supported device ids are available in a third party repository.,[59],
,In 2020, a new project was introduced to automatically collect information about tested hardware configurations.,[60],
,
,Subprojects,[,edit,],
,Many open source projects started as components of OpenBSD, including:
,
,
,bioctl,, a generic ,RAID, management interface similar to ,ifconfig,
,CARP,, a free alternative to ,Cisco,'s patented ,HSRP,/,VRRP, redundancy protocols,
,cwm,, a stacking window manager,
,OpenBSD httpd,,,[61],[62], an implementation of ,httpd,
,hw.sensors,, a sensors framework used by over 100 drivers,
,LibreSSL,, an implementation of the ,SSL, and ,TLS, protocols, forked from ,OpenSSL, 1.0.1g,[63],
,OpenBGPD,, an implementation of ,BGP-4,[64],
,OpenIKED,, an implementation of ,IKEv2,[65],
,OpenNTPD,, a simpler alternative to ntp.org's ,NTP, daemon,[66],
,OpenOSPFD,, an implementation of ,OSPF,[64],
,OpenSMTPD,, an ,SMTP, daemon with ,IPv4,/,IPv6,, ,PAM,, ,Maildir,, and virtual domains support,[67],
,OpenSSH,, an implementation of ,SSH,[68],
,PF,, an ,IPv4,/,IPv6, stateful firewall with ,NAT,, ,PAT,, ,QoS, and traffic normalization support,
,pfsync,, a firewall state synchronization protocol for ,PF, with ,high availability, support using ,CARP,
,sndio,, a compact audio and MIDI framework,
,spamd,, a spam filter with ,greylisting, support designed to inter-operate with ,PF,
,Xenocara,, a customized ,X.Org, build infrastructure,[25],
,
,Some subsystems have been integrated into other BSD operating systems,,[69],[70],[71], and many are available as packages for use in other Unix-like systems.,[72],[73],[74],
,Linux administrator Carlos Fenollosa commented on moving from Linux to OpenBSD that the system is faithful to the ,Unix philosophy, of small, simple tools that work together well: ""Some base components are not as feature-rich, on purpose. Since 99% of the servers don't need the flexibility of Apache, OpenBSD's httpd will work fine, be more secure, and probably faster"".,[75], He characterized the developer community's attitude to components as: ""When the community decides that some module sucks, they develop a new one from scratch. OpenBSD has its own NTPd, SMTPd and, more recently, HTTPd. They work great"".,[75], As a result, OpenBSD is relatively prolific in creating components that become widely reused by other systems.
,OpenBSD runs nearly all of its standard ,daemons, within ,chroot, and ,privsep, security structures by default, as part of hardening the base system.,[75],
,The ,Calgary Internet Exchange, was formed in 2012, in part to serve the needs of the OpenBSD project.,[76],
,
,Third-party components,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD includes a number of ,third-party components,, many with OpenBSD-specific patches,,[29], such as ,X.Org,, ,Clang,[77], (the default ,compiler, on several ,architectures,), ,GCC,,,[36],[n 3], ,Perl,, ,NSD,, ,Unbound,, ,ncurses,, ,GNU binutils,, ,GDB,, and ,AWK,.
,
,Development,[,edit,],
,  ,OpenBSD developers at c2k1 ,hackathon, at ,MIT,, June 2001,
,Development is continuous, and team management is open and tiered. Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute, with commit rights being awarded on merit and De Raadt acting as coordinator.,[27],:,xxxv, Two official releases are made per year, with the version number incremented by 0.1,,[78], and these are each supported for twelve months (two release cycles).,[79], Snapshot releases are also available at frequent intervals.
,Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied manually or by updating the system against the patch branch of the ,CVS, repository for that release.,[80], Alternatively, a system administrator may opt to upgrade using a snapshot release and then regularly update the system against the ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},-current, branch of the CVS repository, in order to gain pre-release access to recently added features.
,The generic OpenBSD kernel provided by default is strongly recommended for end users, in contrast to operating systems that recommend user kernel customization.,[81],
,Packages outside the base system are maintained by CVS through a ,ports tree, and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers, known as porters. As well as keeping the current branch up to date, porters are expected to apply appropriate bug-fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of their package for OpenBSD's supported releases. Ports are generally not subject to the same continuous auditing as the base system due to lack of manpower.
,Binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture. This process is applied for the current version, for each supported release, and for each snapshot. Administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree, unless they need to perform their own source changes.
,OpenBSD's developers regularly meet at special events called ,hackathons,,,[82], where they ""sit down and code"", emphasizing productivity.,[83],
,
,  ,OpenBSD hackathon s2k17,
,Most new releases include a song.,[84],
,
,Open source and open documentation,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD is known for its high-quality documentation, considered the best among the BSD operating systems, all of which emphasize correct documentation.,[85],[86],
,When OpenBSD was created, De Raadt decided that the ,source code, should be available for anyone to read. At the time, a small team of developers generally had access to a project's source code.,[87], Chuck Cranor,[88], and De Raadt concluded this practice was ""counter to the open source philosophy"" and inconvenient to potential contributors. Together, Cranor and De Raadt set up the first public, anonymous ,CVS, server. De Raadt's decision allowed users to ""take a more active role"", and established the project's commitment to open access.,[87],
,OpenBSD does not include ,closed source, binary drivers in the source tree, nor do they include code requiring the signing of ,non-disclosure agreements,.,[89],
,Since OpenBSD is based in Canada, no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply, allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption. For example, the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key, ensuring that sensitive data does not leak into an insecure part of the system.,[15],
,OpenBSD randomizes various behaviors of applications, making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack. For example, PIDs are created and associated randomly to processes; the ,bind, ,system call, uses random ,port numbers,; files are created with random ,inode, numbers; and IP datagrams have random identifiers.,[90], This approach also helps expose bugs in the kernel and in user space programs.
,The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation: in the slides for a December 2006 presentation, De Raadt explained that without it ""developers often make mistakes writing drivers"", and pointed out that ""the [oh my god, I got it to work] rush is harder to achieve, and some developers just give up."",[91], He went on to say that vendor-supplied binary drivers are unacceptable for inclusion in OpenBSD, that they have ""no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel"" and that there is ""no way to fix [them] ... when they break."",[91],
,
,Licensing,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Free software license,
,OpenBSD maintains a strict ,license, policy,,[3], preferring the ,ISC license, and other variants of the ,BSD license,. The project attempts to ""maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix ,copyrights,,"" which permitted a ""relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution."",[3], The widely used ,Apache License, and ,GNU General Public License, are considered overly restrictive.,[92],
,In June 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification of IPFilter's license wording, a systematic license audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken.,[93], Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed, ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license. To ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to, an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were removed, many were replaced, and others, such as the ,multicast, ,routing, tools ,mrinfo, and ,map-mbone,, were ,relicensed, so that OpenBSD could continue to use them.,[94],[95], Also removed during this audit was all software produced by ,Daniel J. Bernstein,. At the time, Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution, a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort.,[96],[97],[98],
,Because of licensing concerns, the OpenBSD team has reimplemented software from scratch or adopted suitable existing software. For example, OpenBSD developers created the ,PF, ,packet filter, after unacceptable restrictions were imposed on ,IPFilter,. PF first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0,[99], and is now available in many other operating systems.,[100], OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL-licensed tools (such as ,CVS,, ,diff,, ,grep, and ,pkg-config,) with ,permissively licensed, equivalents.,[101],[102],
,
,Funding,[,edit,],
,Although the operating system and its portable components are used in commercial products, De Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry: ""traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs (our other products don't really make us much money). Obviously, that has not been a lot of money."",[78],
,For a two-year period in the early 2000s, the project received funding from ,DARPA,, which ""paid the salaries of 5 people to work completely full-time, bought about $30k in hardware, and paid for 3 hackathons"", from the ,POSSE project,.,[78],
,In 2006, the OpenBSD project experienced financial difficulties.,[103], The ,Mozilla Foundation,[104], and ,GoDaddy,[105], are among the organizations that helped OpenBSD to survive. However, De Raadt expressed concern about the asymmetry of funding: ""I think that contributions should have come first from the vendors, secondly from the corporate users, and thirdly from individual users. But the response has been almost entirely the opposite, with almost a 15-to-1 dollar ratio in favor of the little people. Thanks a lot, little people!"",[78],
,On 14 January 2014, Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs. If sustainable funding was not found, Beck suggested the OpenBSD project would shut down.,[106], The project soon received a US$20,000 donation from Mircea Popescu, the Romanian creator of the MPEx bitcoin stock exchange, paid in ,bitcoins,.,[107], The project raised US$150,000,[108], in response to the appeal, enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short-term future.,[107], Since 2014, several large contributions to the ,OpenBSD Foundation, have come from corporations such as Microsoft,,[109], Facebook, and Google as well as the ,Core Infrastructure Initiative,.,[110],
,During the 2016 and 2017 fundraising campaigns, ,Smartisan,, a Chinese company, was the leading financial contributor to the project.,[111],[112],
,
,Distribution,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD is freely available in various ways: the source can be retrieved by anonymous ,CVS,,,[113], and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded by FTP, HTTP, and rsync.,[114], Prepackaged CD-ROM sets through version 6.0 can be ordered online for a small fee, complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release's theme song. These, with their artwork and other bonuses, have been one of the project's few sources of income, funding hardware, Internet service, and other expenses.,[115], Beginning with version 6.1, CD-ROM sets are no longer released.
,OpenBSD provides a ,package management system, for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system.,[116], Packages are binary files which are extracted, managed and removed using the package tools. On OpenBSD, the source of packages is the ports system, a collection of ,Makefiles, and other infrastructure required to create packages. In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.,[116],
,
,Songs and artwork,[,edit,],
,  ,Puffy, the ,mascot, of OpenBSD,
,  ,3D-rendered, animated OpenBSD mascot ,Puffy,
,Initially, OpenBSD used a haloed version of the ,BSD daemon, mascot drawn by Erick Green, who was asked by De Raadt to create the logo for the 2.3 and 2.4 versions of OpenBSD. Green planned to create a full daemon, including head and body, but only the head was completed in time for OpenBSD 2.3. The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD 2.4.,[117],
,
,  ,OpenBSD 2.3 cover,
,Subsequent releases used variations such as a police daemon by Ty Semaka,,[118], but eventually settled on a ,pufferfish, named Puffy.,[119], Since then, Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork.
,The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design, but later the CD-ROMs, release songs, posters and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the ,Plaid Tongued Devils,.,[84], These have become a part of OpenBSD ,advocacy,, with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project, often through parody.,[120],
,Themes have included ,Puff the Barbarian, in OpenBSD 3.3, which included an 80s ,rock song, and parody of ,Conan the Barbarian, alluding to open documentation,,[84], ,The Wizard of OS, in OpenBSD 3.7, related to the project's work on wireless drivers, and ,Hackers of the Lost RAID,, a parody of ,Indiana Jones, referencing the new RAID tools in OpenBSD 3.8.

,Unix, (,/,ˈ,j,uː,n,ɪ,k,s,/,; trademarked as ,UNIX,) is a family of ,multitasking,, ,multiuser, computer ,operating systems, that derive from the original ,AT&T, Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the ,Bell Labs, research center by ,Ken Thompson,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, and others.,[3],
,Initially intended for use inside the ,Bell System,, AT&T ,licensed, Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including ,University of California, Berkeley, (,BSD,), ,Microsoft, (,Xenix,), ,Sun Microsystems, (,SunOS,/,Solaris,), ,HP,/,HPE, (,HP-UX,), and ,IBM, (,AIX,). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to ,Novell,, which then sold its Unix business to the ,Santa Cruz Operation, (SCO) in 1995.,[4], The UNIX trademark passed to ,The Open Group,, a neutral industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the ,Single UNIX Specification, (SUS). However, Novell continues to own the Unix copyrights, which the ,SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., court case (2010) confirmed.
,Unix systems are characterized by a ,modular design, that is sometimes called the "",Unix philosophy,"".  According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function.,[5], A unified ,filesystem, (the ,Unix filesystem,) and an ,inter-process communication, mechanism known as "",pipes,"" serve as the main means of communication,,[3], and a ,shell, scripting and command language (the ,Unix shell,) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.
,Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first ,portable, operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the ,C programming language,, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.,[6],

,Overview,[,edit,],
,  ,Version 7 Unix,, the ,Research Unix, ancestor of all modern Unix systems,
,Unix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmers.,[7],[8],  The system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in academic circles, and as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues.,[9],
,At first, Unix was not designed to be ,portable,[6], or for ,multi-tasking,.,[10],  Later, Unix gradually gained portability, multi-tasking and ,multi-user, capabilities in a ,time-sharing, configuration.  Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of ,plain text, for storing data; a hierarchical ,file system,; treating devices and certain types of ,inter-process communication, (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of ,software tools,, small programs that can be strung together through a ,command-line interpreter, using ,pipes,, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.  These concepts are collectively known as the "",Unix philosophy,"".  ,Brian Kernighan, and ,Rob Pike, summarize this in ,The Unix Programming Environment, as ""the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves"".,[11],
,By the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.,[12],[13],  The Unix environment and the ,client–server, program model were essential elements in the development of the ,Internet, and the reshaping of computing as centered in ,networks, rather than in individual computers.
,Both Unix and the ,C programming language, were developed by AT&T and distributed to government and academic institutions, which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system.
,The Unix operating system consists of many libraries and utilities along with the master control program, the ,kernel,. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the ,file system, and other common ""low-level"" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously.  To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the distinction of ,kernel space, from ,user space,, the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate.
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,History of Unix,
,  ,Ken Thompson, (sitting) and ,Dennis Ritchie, working together at a ,PDP-11,
,The origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,, ,Bell Labs,, and ,General Electric, were developing ,Multics,, a ,time-sharing, operating system for the ,GE-645, mainframe computer.,[14],
Multics featured ,several innovations,, but also presented severe problems. Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics, but not by its goals, individual researchers at Bell Labs started withdrawing from the project. The last to leave were ,Ken Thompson,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,Douglas McIlroy,, and ,Joe Ossanna,,,[10], who decided to reimplement their experiences in a new project of smaller scale. This new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name.
,The new operating system was a single-tasking system.,[10], In 1970, the group coined the name ,Unics, for ,Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, (pronounced "",eunuchs,""), as a ,pun, on ,Multics,, which stood for ,Multiplexed Information and Computer Services,.  ,Brian Kernighan, takes credit for the idea, but adds that ""no one can remember"" the origin of the final spelling ,Unix,.,[15],  Dennis Ritchie,,[10], Doug McIlroy,,[1], and ,Peter G. Neumann,[16], also credit Kernighan.
,The operating system was originally written in ,assembly language,, 
but in 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in ,C,.,[10], Version 4 Unix, however, still had many ,PDP-11, dependent codes, and was not suitable for porting.  The first port to another platform was made five years later (1978) for the ,Interdata 8/32,.,[17],
,Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as "",Research Unix,"".  In 1975, the first source license for ,UNIX, was sold to ,Donald B. Gillies, at the ,University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Department of Computer Science.,[18],  UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson, who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs, was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license.,[19],
,During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (,BSD, and ,System V,) by commercial startups, which in turn led to Unix fragmenting into multiple, similar but often slightly mutually-incompatible systems including ,DYNIX,, ,HP-UX,, ,SunOS,/,Solaris,, ,AIX,, and ,Xenix,.  In the late 1980s, AT&T ,Unix System Laboratories, and ,Sun Microsystems, developed System V Release 4 (,SVR4,), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors.
,In the 1990s, Unix and ,Unix-like, systems grew in popularity and became the operating system of choice for ,over 90% of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers,,,[20], as BSD and ,Linux, distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers.  In 2000, Apple released ,Darwin,, also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, later renamed ,macOS,.,[21],
,Unix operating systems are widely used in modern ,servers,, ,workstations,, and ,mobile devices,.,[22],
,
,Standards,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,Common Desktop Environment, (CDE), part of the ,COSE initiative,
,In the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as ,POSIX, provided a common baseline for all operating systems; ,IEEE, based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the ,Common Open Software Environment, (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the ,Single UNIX Specification, (SUS) administered by ,The Open Group,. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the ,Austin Group,, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.
,In 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's ,Executable and Linkable Format, (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.
,The ,Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.

,The Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the ,kernel, of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.,[,according to whom?,],
,The inclusion of these components did not make the system large –  the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10 MB and arrived on a single nine-track ,magnetic tape,. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.
,The names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many,[,who?,], to have the canonical early structure:
,
,Kernel, –  source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:
,conf, –  configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code,
,dev, –  device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware),
,sys, –  operating system ""kernel"", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.,
,h, –  header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables,
,Development environment, –  early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:
,cc, –  ,C language, compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix),
,as, –  machine-language assembler for the machine,
,ld, –  linker, for combining object files,
,lib, –  object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ,libc,, the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (,libm,) or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern ""Standard I/O"" library ,stdio, as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.,
,make, –  build manager (introduced in ,PWB/UNIX,), for effectively automating the build process,
,include, –  header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants,
,Other languages, –  V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (,bc,, ,dc,), and the ,awk, scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included ,Pascal, tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the ,GNU Compiler Collection, as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.,
,Other tools, –  including an object-code archive manager (,ar,), symbol-table lister (,nm,), compiler-development tools (e.g. ,lex, & ,yacc,), and debugging tools.,
,Commands, –  Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ,cron,), commands of general utility (e.g. ,grep,), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:
,sh, –  the ""shell"" programmable ,command-line interpreter,, the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a ""command window"").,
,Utilities, –  the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ,cp,, ,ls,, ,grep,, ,find, and many others. Subcategories include:
,System utilities, –  administrative tools such as ,mkfs,, ,fsck,, and many others.,
,User utilities, –  environment management tools such as ,passwd,, ,kill,, and others.,
,Document formatting, –  Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ,nroff,, ,troff,, ,tbl,, ,eqn,, ,refer,, and ,pic,. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as ,TeX, and ,Ghostscript,.,
,Graphics, –  the ,plot, subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include ,X11, as a standard windowing system and ,GUI,, and many support ,OpenGL,.,
,Communications, –  early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ,mail, and ,write,. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system ,UUCP,, and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included ,TCP/IP, utilities.,
,Documentation, –  Unix was the first,[,citation needed,], operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:
,man, –  manual pages for each command, library component, ,system call,, header file, etc.,
,doc, –  longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff,

,  ,Photo from ,USENIX, 1984, including ,Dennis Ritchie, (center),
,  ,Plan 9 from Bell Labs, extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix.,
,The Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in ,assembly language,, but was soon rewritten in ,C,, a ,high-level programming language,.,[23], Although this followed the lead of ,Multics, and ,Burroughs,, it was Unix that popularized the idea.
,Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as ,printers,, ,terminals,, or ,disk drives,), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ,ioctl, and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple ""stream of bytes"" model. The ,Plan 9, operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.
,Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's ,RSX-11,M's ""group, user"" hierarchy evolved into ,VMS, directories, ,CP/M,'s volumes evolved into ,MS-DOS, 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's ,MPE, group.account hierarchy and IBM's ,SSP, and ,OS/400, library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.
,Making the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The ,Unix shell, used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (,shell scripts, – there was no separate job control language like IBM's ,JCL,). Since the shell and OS commands were ""just another program"", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes (,pipelines,) made a powerful programming paradigm (,coroutines,) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.
,A fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on ,newline,-,delimited, text for nearly all file formats. There were no ""binary"" editors in the original version of Unix – the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte – unlike ,""record-based"" file systems,. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ,ad hoc, tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages (,PostScript,, ,ODF,), and at the application layer of the ,Internet protocols,, e.g., ,FTP,, ,SMTP,, ,HTTP,, ,SOAP,, and ,SIP,.
,Unix popularized a syntax for ,regular expressions, that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The ,C programming language, soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.
,Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of ,modularity, and ,reusability, into ,software engineering, practice, spawning a ""software tools"" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the ,Unix philosophy,.
,The ,TCP/IP networking protocols, were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the ,Internet, explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.
,The Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the ,free software movement, in 1983.

,In 1983, ,Richard Stallman, announced the ,GNU, (short for ""GNU's Not Unix"") project, an ambitious effort to create a ,free software, ,Unix-like, system; ""free"" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, ,GNU Hurd,, had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 ,Linus Torvalds, released the kernel ,Linux, as free software under the ,GNU General Public License,. In addition to their use in the ,GNU, operating system, many GNU packages – such as the ,GNU Compiler Collection, (and the rest of the ,GNU toolchain,), the ,GNU C library, and the ,GNU core utilities, – have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.
,Linux distributions,, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include ,Red Hat Enterprise Linux,, ,Fedora,, ,SUSE Linux Enterprise,, ,openSUSE,, ,Debian GNU/Linux,, ,Ubuntu,, ,Linux Mint,, ,Mandriva Linux,, ,Slackware Linux,, ,Arch Linux, and ,Gentoo,.,[24],
,A free derivative of ,BSD, Unix, ,386BSD,, was released in 1992 and led to the ,NetBSD, and ,FreeBSD, projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (,USL v. BSDi,) by ,Unix System Laboratories,, it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including ,OpenBSD, and ,DragonFly BSD,.
,Linux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.
,In a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:,[25],
,

Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.,
,In the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as ""the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago"".,[25],
,OpenSolaris, was the open-source counterpart to ,Solaris, developed by ,Sun Microsystems,, which included a ,CDDL,-licensed kernel and a primarily ,GNU, userland. However, ,Oracle, discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the ,illumos, kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.
,
,ARPANET,[,edit,],
,In May 1975, ,RFC 681, described the development of ,Network Unix, by the Center for Advanced Computation at the ,University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign,. The system was said to ""present several interesting capabilities as an ,ARPANET, mini-host"". At the time Unix required a license from ,Bell Laboratories, that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-,university, users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was ""open to suggestions"" for an ARPANET-wide license.
,Specific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, ,compilers,, ,editors,, a ,document preparation system,, efficient file system and access control, ,mountable, and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as ,special files,, integration of the ,network control program, (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of ,network connections, as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix ,I/O calls,, closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be ""desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel"".

,Branding,[,edit,],
,See also: ,List of Unix systems,
,  ,Promotional ,license plate, by ,Digital Equipment Corporation,
,  ,HP9000, ,workstation, running ,HP-UX,, a certified Unix operating system,
,In October 1993, ,Novell,, the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the ,trademarks, of Unix to the X/Open Company (now ,The Open Group,),,[26], and in 1995 sold the related business operations to ,Santa Cruz Operation, (SCO).,[27], Whether Novell also sold the ,copyrights, to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, ,SCO v. Novell,, which Novell won. The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, closing the case.,[28], Unix vendor ,SCO Group Inc., accused Novell of ,slander of title,.
,The present owner of the trademark ,UNIX, is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the ,Single UNIX Specification, qualify as ""UNIX"" (others are called "",Unix-like,"").
,By decree of The Open Group, the term ""UNIX"" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the ,UNIX 98, or ,UNIX 03, trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group.,[29], Systems that have been licensed to use the UNIX trademark include ,AIX,,,[30], ,EulerOS,,,[31], ,HP-UX,,,[32], ,Inspur K-UX,,,[33], ,IRIX,,,[34], ,macOS,,,[35], ,Solaris,,,[36], ,Tru64 UNIX, (formerly ""Digital UNIX"", or ,OSF/1,),,[37], and ,z/OS,.,[38], Notably, EulerOS and Inspur K-UX are Linux distributions certified as UNIX 03 compliant.,[39],[40],
,Sometimes a representation like ,Un*x,, ,*NIX,, or ,*N?X, is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes from the use of the asterisk (,*,) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.
,The Open Group requests that ,UNIX, is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as ,system, to help avoid the creation of a ,genericized trademark,.
,Unix, was the original formatting,,[,disputed, , – ,discuss,], but the usage of ,UNIX, remains widespread because it was once typeset in ,small caps, (,Unix,). According to ,Dennis Ritchie,, when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American ,Association for Computing Machinery, (ACM), ""we had a new typesetter and ,troff, had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps"".,[41], Many of the operating system's predecessors and contemporaries used all-uppercase lettering, so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit. It is not an acronym.,[42],
,Trademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix has been used as a brand name for various products including bookshelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair driers and food containers.,[43],
,Several plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix-like systems. Most common is the conventional ,Unixes,, but ,Unices,, treating Unix as a ,Latin, noun of the ,third declension,, is also popular. The pseudo-,Anglo-Saxon, plural form ,Unixen, is not common, although occasionally seen. ,Sun Microsystems,, developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term ,Unix, is itself plural, referencing its many implementations.,[44],

,

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Theo de Raadt is the eldest of four children to a ,Dutch, father and a ,South African, mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces ,conscription, in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983, the ,largest recession in Canada, since the ,Great Depression, sent the family to the ,Yukon,. Prior to the move, De Raadt got his first computer, a ,Commodore VIC-20,, which was soon followed by an ,Amiga,. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software.,[2], In 1992, he obtained a ,BSc, in ,Computer Science, from the ,University of Calgary,.
,
,NetBSD,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,NetBSD,
,In 1993, Theo de Raadt founded NetBSD with Chris Demetriou, Adam Glass, and Charles Hannum, who felt frustrated at the poor quality of ,386BSD, and believed an open development model would be better.   386BSD was derived from the original University of California Berkeley's 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases.
,The new project focused on clean, portable, correct code, with the goal of producing a unified, multi-platform, production-quality BSD operating system. Because of the importance of networks such as the Internet in the distributed, collaborative nature of its development, De Raadt suggested the name ""NetBSD"", which the three other founders agreed upon.,[,citation needed,],
,The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April 1993.  This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements.  In August 1993, NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a ,PC,-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.
,NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, 1994.  This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the ,IBM PC compatible,, ,HP 9000, Series 300, ,Amiga,, ,68k, ,Macintosh,, ,Sun-4c, series and ,PC532,.  Also in this release, the legally encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the  ,USL v BSDi, lawsuit settlement.  De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the ,SPARC, port, implementing much of the initial code together with  Chuck Cranor.,[3],
,
,OpenBSD,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,OpenBSD,
,In December 1994, Theo de Raadt was forced to resign from the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source repository was revoked. Fellow team members claimed it was due to personality clashes on the ,mailing lists,.,[4],
,In his book ,Free for All,, Peter Wayner claims that De Raadt ""began to rub some people the wrong way"" before the split from NetBSD,,[5], while ,Linus Torvalds, has described him as ""difficult"".,[6], Many have different feelings: the same interviewer describes De Raadt's ""transformation"" on founding OpenBSD and his ""desire to take care of his team,"" some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and De Raadt remains widely respected as a ,hacker,[7], and security expert.,[8],
,In October 1995, De Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project ,forked, from NetBSD 1.0. The initial ,release,, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.,[9], Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is maintained and supported for one year.
,
,Outspokenness,[,edit,],
,  ,Jon ""maddog"" Hall, presents De Raadt with ,daemon, horns at ,FISL8,
,De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of free software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he is also a strong proponent of free speech, having on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments.  This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; De Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world—including ,FOSDEM, in ,Brussels,, ,Belgium,, ,Usenix, in ,San Antonio, Texas,, ,U.S.,, ,AUUG, Conference in ,Melbourne,, ,Australia, and ,FISL, in ,Porto Alegre,, RS, ,Brazil,.
,
,DARPA funding cancellation,[,edit,],
,After De Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led ,invasion of Iraq, in an April, 2003 ,interview,[10], with ,Toronto,'s ,Globe and Mail,, a multi-million-dollar ,US Department of Defense, grant to the ,University of Pennsylvania,'s ,POSSE project, was cancelled, effectively ending the project.  Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the ,hackathon, planned for May 8, 2003.  Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms.,[11],  This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-,free speech, attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it.  The project's supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned.  The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant's termination.
,
,Free driver advocacy,[,edit,],
,De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of ,free software, ,drivers,.  He has long been critical of developers of ,Linux, and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of ,non-disclosure agreements,.
,In particular, De Raadt has worked to convince ,wireless, hardware vendors to allow the ,firmware, images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with ,Taiwanese, companies, leading to many new wireless drivers. De Raadt has commented that ""most Taiwanese vendors give us documentation almost immediately,"" allowing open source drivers to reliably support devices, as opposed to the lack of willingness from US companies like ,Intel, and ,Broadcom, to release firmware images free from ,licensing, restrictions.,[12],
,
,Clash with Linux developers,[,edit,],
,In April 2007, De Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of ,GPL, code from the Linux ,bcm43xx, driver in the BSD ,bcw, driver.,[13],[14],  Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but De Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not ""released"".  He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer ,Michael Buesch, handled the situation.  To Buesch's email, he responded:,[15],
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},
,It will be resolved in our tree, but it is up to him which way he does
it.  But when you approach issues like this with comments like ""We'd
like you to start contacting us to resolve the issue now"" and your
first mail is cc'd to a couple hundred people.... in the future,
please think more carefully, ok?
,Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's
job for them.  You've told the entire BSD community who may want to
use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you
are willing to use very strong words—published very widely—to
disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them.
And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even.  You did not
privately mail that developer.  No, you basically went public with it.
,That is how about half the user and developer community will see it.
,
They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.,
,Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver. De Raadt summarised the issue as follows:,[16],
,
,
,GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code, modify it, and not give back.
Nope—the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code, and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out.
Just like the Linux community, we have many companies giving us code back, all the time.
,
But once the code is GPL'd, we cannot get it back.,

,History,[,edit,],
,Taylor Otwell created Laravel as an attempt to provide a more advanced alternative to the ,CodeIgniter, framework, which did not provide certain features such as built-in support for user ,authentication, and ,authorization,.  Laravel's first ,beta release, was made available on June 9, 2011, followed by the Laravel 1 release later in the same month.  Laravel 1 included built-in support for authentication, ,localisation,, ,models,, ,views,, ,sessions,, routing and other mechanisms, but lacked support for ,controllers, that prevented it from being a true ,MVC, framework.,[1],
,Laravel 2 was released in September 2011, bringing various improvements from the author and community.  Major new features included the support for controllers, which made Laravel 2 a fully MVC-compliant framework, built-in support for the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, and a ,templating system, called ,Blade,.  As a downside, support for third-party ,packages, was removed in Laravel 2.,[1],
,Laravel 3 was released in February 2012 with a set of new features including the ,command-line interface, (CLI) named ,Artisan,, built-in support for more ,database management systems,, database migrations as a form of ,version control, for database layouts, support for handling ,events,, and a packaging system called ,Bundles,.  An increase of Laravel's userbase and popularity lined up with the release of Laravel 3.,[1],
,Laravel 4, codenamed ,Illuminate,, was released in May 2013.  It was made as a complete rewrite of the Laravel framework, migrating its layout into a set of separate packages distributed through ,Composer,, which serves as an ,application-level package manager,.  Such a layout improved the extensibility of Laravel 4, which was paired with its official regular release schedule spanning six months between minor ,point releases,.  Other new features in the Laravel 4 release include ,database seeding, for the initial population of databases, support for ,message queues,, built-in support for sending different types of email, and support for delayed deletion of database records called ,soft deletion,.,[1],[9],:,18–19,
,Laravel 5 was released in February 2015 as a result of internal changes that ended up in renumbering the then-future Laravel 4.3 release.  New features in the Laravel 5 release include support for scheduling periodically executed tasks through a package called ,Scheduler,, an abstraction layer called ,Flysystem, that allows remote storage to be used in the same way as local ,file systems,, improved handling of package assets through ,Elixir,, and simplified externally handled authentication through the optional ,Socialite, package. Laravel 5 also introduced a new internal ,directory tree, structure for developed applications.,[5],:,13–14,[10],
,Laravel 5.1, released in June 2015, was the first release of Laravel to receive ,long-term support, (LTS). New LTS versions were planned for one every two years.,[11],
,Laravel 5.3 was released on August 23, 2016. The new features in 5.3 are focused on improving developer speed by adding additional out of the box improvements for common tasks.,[12],
,Laravel 5.4 was released on January 24, 2017, with many new features like Laravel Dusk, Laravel Mix, Blade Components and Slots, Markdown Emails, Automatic Facades, Route Improvements, Higher Order Messaging for Collections, and many others.,[13],
,Laravel 6 was released on September 3, 2019, shift blueprint code generation, introducing semantic versioning, compatibility with Laravel Vapor, improved authorization responses, improved job middleware, lazy collections, and sub-query improvements. The frontend scaffolding was removed from the main package and moved into the laravel/ui package.,[14],
,Laravel 7 was released on March 3, 2020, with new features like Laravel Sanctum, Custom Eloquent Casts, Blade Component Tags, Fluent String Operations and Route Model Binding Improvements. ,[15],
,The latest Laravel version is version 8, which was released on September 8, 2020, with new features like Laravel Jetstream, model factory classes, migration squashing, Tailwind CSS for pagination views and other usability improvements. ,[16],
,
,Release history,[,edit,],
,Versions designated LTS are supported with bug fixes for 2 years and security fixes for 3 years. Other releases are supported with bug fixes for 6 months and security fixes for 1 year.,[17],

,
,Features,[,edit,],
,The following features serve as Laravel's key design points (where not specifically noted, descriptions refer to the features of Laravel 3):,[4],[5],:,5–9,[6],[7],[22],
,
,Bundles, provide a modular. ,packaging system, since the release of Laravel 3, with bundled features already available for easy addition to applications.  Furthermore, Laravel 4 uses Composer as a dependency manager to add framework-agnostic and Laravel-specific PHP packages available from the ,Packagist, repository.,[23],
,Eloquent ORM, (,object-relational mapping,) is an advanced PHP implementation of the ,active record pattern,, providing at the same time internal methods for enforcing constraints on the relationships between ,database, objects.  Following the active record pattern, Eloquent ORM presents ,database tables, as ,classes,, with their ,object instances, tied to single ,table rows,.,[24],
,Query builder,, available since Laravel 3, provides a more direct database access alternative to the Eloquent ORM.  Instead of requiring ,SQL queries, to be written directly, Laravel's query builder provides a set of classes and ,methods, capable of building queries programmatically.  It also allows selectable ,caching, of the results of executed queries.,[25],
,Application logic, is an integral part of developed applications, implemented either by using ,controllers, or as part of the route declarations.  The ,syntax, used to define application logic is similar to the one used by ,Sinatra, framework.,
,Reverse routing, defines a relationship between the links and routes, making it possible for later changes to routes to be automatically propagated into relevant links.  When the links are created by using names of existing routes, the appropriate ,uniform resource identifiers, (URIs) are automatically created by Laravel.,
,Restful controllers, provide an optional way for separating the logic behind serving ,HTTP GET, and ,POST, requests.,
,Class auto loading, provides automated loading of PHP classes without the need for manual maintenance of inclusion paths.  On-demand loading prevents inclusion of unnecessary components, so only the actually used components are loaded.,
,View, composers, serve as customizable logical code units that can be executed when a view is loaded.,
,Blade, ,templating engine, combines one or more templates with a ,data model, to produce resulting views, doing that by ,transpiling, the templates into cached PHP code for improved performance.  Blade also provides a set of its own ,control structures, such as ,conditional statements, and ,loops,, which are internally mapped to their PHP counterparts.  Furthermore, Laravel services may be called from Blade templates, and the templating engine itself can be extended with custom directives.,[26],[27],
,IoC containers, make it possible for new objects to be generated by following the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, in which the framework calls into the application- or task-specific code, with optional instantiating and referencing of new objects as ,singletons,.,
,Migrations, provide a ,version control, system for ,database schemas,, making it possible to associate changes in the application's ,codebase, and required changes in the database layout.  As a result, this feature simplifies the ,deployment, and updating of Laravel-based applications.,[28],
,Database seeding, provides a way to populate database tables with selected default data that can be used for application ,testing, or be performed as part of the initial application setup.,[28],
,Unit testing, is provided as an integral part of Laravel,,[9],:,61–62, which itself contains unit tests that detect and prevent ,regressions, in the framework.  Unit tests can be run through the provided ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},artisan, ,command-line utility,.,
,Automatic pagination, simplifies the task of implementing pagination, replacing the usual manual implementation approaches with automated methods integrated into Laravel.,
,Form request, is a feature of Laravel 5 that serves as the base for ,form, input validation by internally binding ,event, listeners, resulting in automated invoking of the form validation methods and generation of the actual form.,[29],
,Homestead, - a ,Vagrant, ,virtual machine, that provides Laravel developers with all the tools necessary to develop Laravel straight out of the box, including, ,Ubuntu,, ,Gulp,, Bower and other development tools that are useful in developing full scale web applications.,[30],
,Canvas, - a Laravel-powered publishing platform that helps visualize monthly trends, see where readers are coming from and what time of day they prefer to read content. Features like: Publication Statistics, Distraction-free writing, ,Unsplash, Integration, Custom Social Data.,[31],
,Lazy Collection - This feature of the PHP framework Laravel 6, primarily enables you to deal with heavy loads of data, while keeping the memory usage low. Moreover, when you switch from all ( _ to cursor ( ), just one expressive model is moved within the memory at a time as cursor ( ) makes use of the LazyCollection instance.,
,First-party Packages,[,edit,],
,Ready-to-use packages provided by Laravel through Composer and Packagist include the following:
,
,Cashier,, introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides an interface for managing subscription billing services provided by ,Stripe,, such as handling ,coupons, and generating ,invoices,.,[32],
,Envoy,, introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides a clean, minimal syntax for defining common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using Blade style syntax, you can easily setup tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more.,[33],
,Socialite,, provides simplified mechanisms for authentication with different ,OAuth, providers, including ,Facebook,, ,Twitter,, ,Google,, ,GitHub, and ,Bitbucket,.,[34],
,Passport,, introduced in Laravel 5.3, provides a full ,OAuth2, server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter.,[35],
,Scout,, introduced in Laravel 5.3, provides a simple, driver based solution for adding full-text search to your Eloquent models.,[36],
,Dusk,, introduced in Laravel 5.4, provides an expressive, easy-to-use browser automation and testing API.,[37],
,Horizon,, introduced in Laravel 5.5, provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Laravel powered ,Redis, queues.,[38],
,Telescope,, introduced in Laravel 5.7, provides insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps and more.,[39],
,Sanctum,, introduced in Laravel 7.0, provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs (single page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token based APIs.,[40],. Firstly called Laravel Airlock, it has been renamed due to a trademark dispute regarding the name ‘Airlock.',[41],
,Artisan CLI,[,edit,],
,Laravel's ,command-line interface, (CLI), called ,Artisan,, was initially introduced in Laravel 3 with a limited set of capabilities.  Laravel's later migration to a Composer-based architecture allowed Artisan to incorporate different components from the ,Symfony, framework, resulting in the availability of additional Artisan features in Laravel 4.,[9],:,73–83,[42],
,The features of Artisan are mapped to different subcommands of the ,Artisan, command-line utility, providing functionality that aids in managing and building Laravel-based applications.  Common uses of Artisan include managing database migrations and seeding, publishing package assets, and generating ,boilerplate code, for new controllers and migrations; the latter frees the developer from creating proper code ,skeletons,.  The functionality and capabilities of Artisan can also be expanded by implementing new custom commands, which, for example, may be used to automate application-specific recurring tasks.,[9],:,73–83,[42],
,
,Conferences,[,edit,],
,  ,Taylor Otwell at the 2013 US Laracon,
,Laracon, is the official Laravel conference centered around the Laravel framework, covering its development, uses, and related general ,software development, topics. Laracon has taken place in the ,United States,, ,Europe, and online in the past.,[43],[44], Typically, the conference happens in the ,United States, and ,Europe, every year. 2017 was the first year a Laracon was held as an online event only. 2018 was the first year a Laracon was held in Australia. Each year the conference has a different variety of sponsors and organizers, but Laravel, Laravel News and UserScape are usually the primary organizers.
,While the numerous Laracon conferences are officially run, a number of other conferences are run under the name of Laravel Live. Currently there are yearly held Laravel Live UK and Laravel Live India conferences,[45],[46],. While these are not officially run, they have the permission of Taylor Otwell to use the name Laravel.

,Vim, (,/,v,ɪ,m,/,;,[2], a contraction of ,Vi IMproved,) is a clone, with additions, of ,Bill Joy,'s ,vi, ,text editor, program for Unix. Vim's author, ,Bram Moolenaar,, based it on the ,source code, for a port of the ,Stevie editor, to the ,Amiga,[3], and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a ,command-line interface, and as a standalone application in a ,graphical user interface,. Vim is ,free and open-source software, and is released under a license that includes some ,charityware, clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in ,Uganda,.,[4], The license is compatible with the ,GNU General Public License, through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies ""under the ,GNU, GPL version 2 or any later version"".,[5],
,Since its release for the Amiga, ,cross-platform, development has made it available on ,many other systems,. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst ,Linux Journal, readers;,[6], in 2015 the ,Stack Overflow, developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor,,[7], and the fifth most popular development environment in 2019.,[8],

,History,[,edit,],
,Vim's forerunner, ,Stevie (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts),, was created by Tim Thompson for the ,Atari ST, in 1987,[9],[10], and further developed by Tony Andrews,[9],[11], and G.R. (Fred) Walter.,[12],[13],
,Basing his work on Stevie, ,Bram Moolenaar, began working on Vim for the ,Amiga, computer in 1988, with the first public release (Vim v1.14) in 1991.,[14],[15],[,better source needed,],
,At the time of its first release, the name ""Vim"" was an acronym for ""Vi IMitation"", but this changed to ""'Vi IMproved"" late in 1993.,[16],

,
,Interface,[,edit,],
,  ,Graphical Vim (gVim) under ,GTK+ 2,.,
,  ,Code at the top (Go), opened files, registers (""clipboard manager"" and macros history),
,Like ,vi,, Vim's interface is not based on menus or icons but on commands given in a ,text user interface,; its ,GUI, mode, ,gVim,, adds menus and toolbars for commonly used commands but the full functionality is still expressed through its ,command line, mode. Vi (and by extension Vim) tends to allow a typist to keep their fingers on the ,home row,, which can be an advantage for a ,touch typist,.,[29],
,Vim has a built-in ,tutorial, for beginners called vimtutor. It's usually installed along with Vim, but it exists as a separate executable and can be run with a shell command.,[30], There is also the Vim ,Users' Manual, that details Vim's features and a ,FAQ,. This manual can be read from within Vim, or found online.,[31],[32],
,Vim also has a built-in help facility (using the ,:help, command) that allows users to query and navigate through commands and features.
,
,  ,Search (grep) inside Vim across files on disk, without plugins,
,Modes,[,edit,],
,Vim has 12 different editing modes, 6 of which are variants of the 6 basic modes.,[33], The basic modes are:
,
,Normal, mode -  used for editor commands. This is also the default mode, unless the ,insertmode, option is specified.,
,Visual, mode - similar to normal mode, but used to highlight areas of text. Normal commands are run on the highlighted area, which for an instance can be used to move or edit a selection.,
,Select, mode - works similarly to visual mode. However, if a printable character, carriage return, or newline (or line feed) is entered, Vim inserts the character, and starts insert mode.,[34],
,Insert, mode - similar to editing in most modern editors. In insert mode, buffers can be modified with the text inserted.,
,Command-line, or ,Cmdline, mode - supports a single line input at the bottom of the Vim window. Normal commands (beginning with ,:,), and some other specific letters corresponding to different actions (including pattern search and the filter command) activate this mode.,
,Ex, mode - similarly to Cmdline mode, it takes a single line input at the bottom of the window. However, in Cmdline mode, entering a command exits the mode when the command is executed. Entering a command in Ex mode doesn't cause the mode to change.,
,  ,Commands history below: we can edit every command and/or run it again,
,Customization,[,edit,],
,Vim is highly customizable and extensible, making it an attractive tool for users who demand a large amount of control and flexibility over their text editing environment.,[35], Text input is facilitated by a variety of features designed to increase keyboard efficiency. Users can execute complex commands with ""key mappings,"" which can be customized and extended. The ""recording"" feature allows for the creation of ,macros, to automate sequences of keystrokes and call internal or user-defined functions and mappings. Abbreviations, similar to macros and key mappings, facilitate the expansion of short strings of text into longer ones and can also be used to correct mistakes. Vim also features an ""easy"" mode for users looking for a simpler text editing solution.,[36],
,There are many ,plugins, available that extend or add new functionality to Vim, such as ,linters,, ,integration with Git,, ,showing colors in CSS,. These complex scripts are usually written in Vim's internal scripting language, vimscript (also known as VimL),,[37], but can be written in other languages as well.
,
,  ,Vim editing JavaScript, with installed plugin GitGutter: pluses at the left shows new lines (according to information from Git).,
,There are projects bundling together complex scripts and customizations and aimed at turning Vim into a tool for a specific task or adding a major flavour to its behaviour. Examples include ,Cream,, which makes Vim behave like a click-and-type editor, or VimOutliner, which provides a comfortable ,outliner, for users of Unix-like systems.
,
,Features and improvements over vi,[,edit,],
,Vim has a vi compatibility mode, but when that mode isn't used, Vim has many enhancements over vi.,[38], However, even in compatibility mode, Vim is not entirely compatible with vi as defined in the ,Single Unix Specification,[39], and ,POSIX, (e.g., Vim does not support vi's open mode, only visual mode). Vim has nevertheless been described as ""very much compatible with Vi"".,[40],
,
,  ,File manager inside vim,
,Some of Vim's enhancements include ,completion,, ,comparison, and ,merging, of files (known as vimdiff), a comprehensive integrated help system, extended ,regular expressions,, ,scripting languages, (both native and through alternative scripting interpreters such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, etc.) including support for ,plugins,, a ,graphical user interface, (known as gvim), limited ,integrated development environment,-like features, ,mouse, interaction (both with and without the GUI), ,folding,, editing of compressed or archived files in ,gzip,, ,bzip2,, ,zip,, and ,tar, format and files over network protocols such as ,SSH,, ,FTP,, and ,HTTP,, session state preservation, ,spell checking,, split (horizontal and vertical) and tabbed windows, ,Unicode, and other multi-language support, ,syntax highlighting,, trans-session command, search and cursor position ,histories,, multiple level and branching ,undo/redo, history which can persist across editing sessions, and visual mode.
,
,  ,:version command display compilation flags (supported features),
,Vim script,[,edit,],
,Vim script, (also called ,vimscript, or ,VimL,),[41], is the ,scripting language, built into Vim.,[42], Based on the ,ex, editor language of the original ,vi, editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and function definitions. Since version 7, Vim script also supports more advanced data types such as ,lists, and ,dictionaries, and (a simple form of) ,object-oriented programming,. Built-in functions such as ,map(), and ,filter(), allow a basic form of ,functional programming,, and Vim script has ,lambda, since version 8.0. Vim script is mostly written in an ,imperative programming style,.
,Vim ,macros, can contain a sequence of ,normal-mode, commands, but can also invoke ex commands or functions written in Vim script for more complex tasks. Almost all extensions (called plugins or more commonly scripts) of the core Vim functionality are written in Vim script, but plugins can also utilize other languages like ,Perl,[43],, ,Python,[44],, ,Lua,[45],, ,Ruby,[46],, ,Tcl,[47],,  or ,Racket,.,[48], These plugins can be installed manually, or through a plugin manager such as Vundle, Pathogen, or Vim-Plug.
,Vim script files are stored as plain text, similarly to other code, and the filename extension is usually ,.vim,. One notable exception to that is Vim's config file, ,.vimrc,.
,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,"" This is the Hello World program in Vim script.,
echo ,""Hello, world!"",

,"" This is a simple while loop in Vim script.,
,let, ,i, ,=, ,1,
,while, ,i, ,<, ,5,
  echo ,""count is"", ,i,
  ,let, ,i, ,+=, ,1,
,endwhile,
unlet ,i,
,
,Availability,[,edit,],
,Whereas ,vi, was originally available only on ,Unix, operating systems, Vim has been ,ported, to many operating systems including ,AmigaOS, (the initial target platform), ,Atari, ,MiNT,, ,BeOS,, ,DOS,, ,Windows, starting from ,Windows NT 3.1,, ,OS/2,, ,OS/390,, ,MorphOS,, ,OpenVMS,, ,QNX,, ,RISC OS,, ,Linux,, ,BSD,, and ,Classic Mac OS,.,[49],  Also, Vim is shipped with every copy of ,Apple, ,macOS,.,[50],
,Independent ports of Vim are available both for ,Android,[51],[52], and ,iOS,.,[53],
,
,Neovim,[,edit,],
,  ,Neovim,
,  ,Screenshot of Neovim,
,  ,Neovim with a status bar plugin,
,Neovim,[54], is a fork – with additions,[55], – of Vim that strives to improve the extensibility and maintainability of Vim.,[56], Neovim shares the same configuration syntax with Vim; as a result, the same ,configuration file, can be used with both editors, although there are minor differences between the exact options used between the two.,[57], If the added features of Neovim are not used, Neovim is compatible with almost all of Vim's features.,[58],
,The Neovim project was started in 2014, with some Vim community members offering early support of the high-level refactoring effort to provide better scripting, plugins, and integration with modern ,GUIs, .,[59],[60],  The project is ,free software, and its ,source code, is available on ,GitHub,.,[61],
,Neovim had a successful fundraiser on 23 March 2014,,[62], supporting at least one full-time developer. Several frontends are under development, making use of Neovim's capabilities.,[63],[64],[65],
,The Neovim editor is available in Ubuntu's PPAs,,[66], and several other package managers,,[67], making it possible to install on a variety of operating systems.

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Models and sample render in version 2.77,
,The ,Dutch, animation studio NeoGeo (not associated with the ,Neo Geo, video game hardware brand) started to develop Blender as an in-house application, and based on the ,timestamps, for the first ,source files,, January 2, 1994 is considered to be Blender's birthday.,[11], The version 1.00 was released in January 1995,,[12], with the primary author being company co-owner and software developer ,Ton Roosendaal,. The name ,Blender, was inspired by a song by the Swiss electronic band ,Yello,, from the album ,Baby, which NeoGeo used in its ,showreel,.,[13],[14], Some of the design choices and experiences for Blender were carried over from an earlier software application, called Traces, that Roosendaal developed for NeoGeo on the Commodore Amiga platform during the 1987–1991 period.,[15],
,On January 1, 1998, Blender was released publicly online as ,SGI, freeware.,[1], NeoGeo was later dissolved and its client contracts were taken over by another company. After NeoGeo's dissolution, Ton Roosendaal founded Not a Number Technologies (NaN) in June 1998 to further develop Blender, initially distributing it as ,shareware, until NaN went bankrupt in 2002. This also meant, at the time, discontinuing the development of Blender.,[16],
,In May 2002, Roosendaal started the non-profit ,Blender Foundation,, with the first goal to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community-based ,open-source, project. On July 18, 2002, Roosendaal started the ,""Free Blender"", campaign, a ,crowdfunding, precursor.,[17],[18], The campaign aimed at open-sourcing Blender for a one-time payment of €100,000 (US$100,670 at the time), with the money being collected from the community.,[19], On September 7, 2002, it was announced that they had collected enough funds and would release the Blender ,source code,. Today, Blender is ,free, and open-source software, largely developed by its community as well as 15 employees employed by the Blender Institute.,[20],
,The Blender Foundation initially reserved the right to use ,dual licensing,, so that, in addition to ,GPLv2,, Blender would have been available also under the ,Blender License, that did not require disclosing source code but required payments to the Blender Foundation. However, they never exercised this option and suspended it indefinitely in 2005.,[21], Blender is solely available under ""GNU GPLv2 or any later"" and was not updated to the ,GPLv3,, as ""no evident benefits"" were seen.,[22],
,In 2019, with the release of version 2.80, the integrated ,game engine, for making and prototyping video games was removed; Blender's developers recommended users migrate to more powerful ,open source, game engines such as ,Godot, instead.,[23],[24],
,
,  ,Suzanne as a 3D model,
,Suzanne, the ""monkey"" mascot,[,edit,],
,In January–February 2002 it was clear that NaN could not survive and would close its doors in March. Nevertheless, they put out one more release, 2.25. As a sort-of ,easter egg,, and last personal tag, the artists and developers decided to add a ,3D model, of a ,chimpanzee, head, although it is called a "",monkey,"" in the software. It was created by Willem-Paul van Overbruggen (SLiD3), who named it ,Suzanne, after the ,orangutan, in the ,Kevin Smith, film ,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,.
,Suzanne is Blender's alternative to more common ,test models, such as the ,Utah Teapot, and the ,Stanford Bunny,. A low-polygon model with only 500 faces, Suzanne is included in Blender and often used as a quick and easy way to test materials, animations, rigs, textures, and lighting setups. The largest Blender contest gives out an award called the Suzanne Award.
,
,Releases,[,edit,],
,Official releases of Blender for ,Microsoft Windows,, ,MacOS, and ,Linux,,,[25], as well as a ,port, for ,FreeBSD,,,[26], are available in both ,32-bit, and ,64-bit, versions. Blender is available for Windows 7 and above, Mac OS X 10.6 and above, and Linux. Blender 2.76b is the last supported release for Windows XP and version 2.63 was the last supported release for ,PowerPC,.,[27],

,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Modeling,[,edit,],
,  ,Forensic facial reconstruction of a mummy by ,Cícero Moraes,
,Primitives,[,edit,],
,Blender has support for a variety of geometric primitives, including ,polygon meshes,, fast ,subdivision surface, modeling, ,Bezier curves,, ,NURBS surfaces,, ,metaballs,, ,icospheres,, text, and an n-gon modeling system called B-mesh.
,
,Modifiers,[,edit,],
,Modifiers apply non-destructive effects.
,
,Sculpting,[,edit,],
,Blender has multi-res ,digital sculpting,, which includes dynamic topology, maps baking, remeshing, re-symmetrize, and decimation.
,
,Simulation,[,edit,],
,Play media,  ,A cloth simulation,Blender can be used to simulate smoke, rain, dust, cloth, fluids, hair and rigid bodies.,[51],
,Fluid simulation,[,edit,],
,  ,Physics fluid simulation,The ,fluid simulator, can be used for simulating liquids, like water hitting a cup.,[52], It uses the ,Lattice Boltzmann methods, to simulate the fluids and allows for lots of adjusting of the amount of particles and the resolution.
,The particle physics fluid simulation creates particles that follow the ,Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, method.,[53], Simulation tools for ,soft body dynamics, including mesh ,collision detection,, ,LBM, ,fluid dynamics,, smoke simulation, ,Bullet, ,rigid body dynamics,, and an ocean generator with waves. A particle system that includes support for particle-based hair. Real-time control during physics simulation and rendering.
,In Blender 2.82 a new fluid sim system called mantaflow was added, replacing the old system.,[54],
,
,Animation,[,edit,],
,Keyframed animation tools including ,inverse kinematics,, ,armature (skeletal),, hook, curve and ,lattice-based deformations,, ,shape animations,, non-linear animation, constraints, and ,vertex weighting,.
,
,Grease Pencil,[,edit,],
,Blender's Grease Pencil tools allow for 2D animation within a full 3D pipeline.
,
,Rendering,[,edit,],
,  ,Rendering of a house,
,Internal render engine with ,scanline rendering,, indirect lighting, and ,ambient occlusion, that can export in a wide variety of formats; A ,path tracer, render engine called Cycles, which can take advantage of the ,GPU, for rendering. Cycles supports the ,Open Shading Language, since Blender 2.65.,[55],
,Eevee is a new ,physically based, real-time renderer. It works both as a renderer for final frames, and as the engine driving Blender's realtime viewport for creating assets. Blender Internal was removed in 2.8.
,
,Texture and shading,[,edit,],
,Blender allows procedural and node-based textures, as well as ,texture painting,, projective painting, ,vertex painting,, ,weight painting, and dynamic painting.
,
,Post-production,[,edit,],
Blender has a node-based compositor within the rendering pipeline accelerated with ,OpenCL,.,  ,The Video Sequence Editor (VSE),
,Blender also includes a non-linear video editor called the Video Sequence Editor (VSE), with support for effects like ,Gaussian blur,, ,color grading,, fade and wipe transitions, and other video transformations. However, there is no multi-core support for rendering video with the VSE.
,
,Plugins/addons and scripts,[,edit,],
,Blender supports ,Python, scripting for creation of custom tools, prototyping, game logic, importing/exporting from other formats and task automation. This allows for integration with a number of external render engines through plugins/addons.
,
,Deprecated features,[,edit,],
,The ,Blender Game Engine, was a built-in real-time graphics and logic engine with features such including ,collision detection,, a dynamics engine, and programmable logic. It also allowed the creation of stand-alone, real-time applications ranging from architectural visualization to ,video games,. In April 2018 it was removed from the upcoming Blender 2.8 release series, having long lagged behind other game engines such as the open-source ,Godot,, and ,Unity,.,[23], In the 2.8 announcement, the Blender team specifically mentioned the Godot engine as a suitable replacement for migrating Blender Game Engine users.,[24],
,Blender Internal, a biased ,rasterization, engine, / ,scanline renderer, used in the previous versions of Blender was also removed for the 2.80 release, in favor of the new Eevee renderer, a realtime PBR renderer.,[56],
,
,File format,[,edit,],
,Blender features an internal file system that can pack multiple scenes into a single file (called a "",.blend,"" file).
,
,Most of Blender's "".blend"" files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender, with the following exceptions:
,Loading animations stored in post-2.5 files in Blender pre-2.5. This is due to the reworked animation subsystem introduced in Blender 2.5 being inherently incompatible with older versions.,
,Loading meshes stored in post 2.63. This is due to the introduction of BMesh, a more versatile mesh format.,
,Blender 2.8 "".blend"" files are no longer fully backwards compatible, causing errors when opened in previous versions.,
,All scenes, objects, materials, textures, sounds, images, post-production effects for an entire animation can be stored in a single "".blend"" file. Data loaded from external sources, such as images and sounds, can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative pathname. Likewise, "".blend"" files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets.,
,Interface configurations are retained in the "".blend"" files.,
,A wide variety of import/export scripts that extend Blender capabilities (accessing the object data via an internal ,API,) make it possible to interoperate with other 3D tools.
,Blender organizes data as various kinds of ""data blocks"", such as Objects, Meshes, Lamps, Scenes, Materials, Images and so on. An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks – for example, what the user would describe as a polygon mesh consists of at least an Object and a Mesh data block, and usually also a Material and many more, linked together. This allows various data blocks to refer to each other. There may be, for example, multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh and making subsequent editing of the shared mesh result in shape changes in all Objects using this Mesh. Objects, meshes, materials, textures etc. can also be linked to from other .blend files, which is what allows the use of .blend files as reusable resource libraries.
,
,Import and export,[,edit,],
,The software supports a variety of 3D file formats for import and export, among them ,Alembic,, ,3D Studio, (3DS), Filmbox (,FBX,), Autodesk (,DXF,), ,SVG,, ,STL, (for 3D printing), UDIM, ,USD,, ,VRML,, ,WebM,, ,X3D, and ,Obj,.
,
,User interface,[,edit,],
,  ,Blender's user interface underwent a significant update during the 2.5x series, and again with the release of Blender 2.80,
,Commands,[,edit,],
,Most of the commands are accessible via ,hotkeys,. There are also comprehensive graphical menus. Numeric buttons can be ""dragged"" to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget, as well as being set using the keyboard. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},Ctrl, and ,Shift, keys. ,Python, expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to specify values.
,
,Modes,[,edit,],
,Blender includes many modes for interacting with objects, the two primary ones being ,Object Mode, and ,Edit Mode,, which are toggled with the ,Tab, key. Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit, while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode can be used to move, scale, and rotate entire ,polygon meshes,, and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.
,
,Workspaces,[,edit,],
,The Blender GUI builds its own tiled windowing system on top of one or multiple windows provided by the underlying platform. One platform window (often sized to fill the screen) is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender's views or window-types. The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows, called screens, and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts. Each window-type's own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate 3D view. For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons using similar controls, one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout are fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or UV mapping or texturing by hiding features not used for the task.

,Rendering engines,[,edit,],
,  ,An architectural render showing different rendering styles in Blender, including a photorealistic style using Cycles,
,Cycles,[,edit,],
,Cycles is a ,path-tracing, ,render engine, that is designed to be interactive and easy to use, while still supporting many features.,[57], It has been included with Blender since 2011, with the release of Blender 2.61.
,
,GPU rendering,[,edit,],
,Cycles supports ,GPU, rendering, which is used to speed up rendering times. There are three GPU rendering modes: ,CUDA,, which is the preferred method for older ,Nvidia, graphics cards; ,OptiX,, which utilizes the hardware ray-tracing capabilities of Nvidia's ,Turing architecture,; and ,OpenCL,, which supports rendering on ,AMD, ,graphics cards,.
,Multiple GPUs are also supported, which can be used to create a ,render farm, – although having multiple GPUs doesn't increase the available ,memory,, because each GPU can only access its own memory.,[58],

,Integrator,[,edit,],
,The ,integrator, is the core ,rendering algorithm, used for ,lighting computations,. Cycles currently supports a ,path tracing, integrator with ,direct light sampling,. It works well for a variety of lighting setups, but it is not as suitable for ,caustics, and certain other complex lighting situations. ,Rays are traced, from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they find a light source (a lamp, an object material emitting light, or the world background), or until they are simply terminated based on the number of ,maximum bounces, determined in the light path settings for the renderer. To find lamps and surfaces emitting light, both ,indirect light sampling, (letting the ray follow the surface ,bidirectional scattering distribution function, or BSDF,) and direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used.,[60],
,
,The two types of integrators,[,edit,],
,The default path tracing integrator is a ""pure"" path tracer. This integrator works by sending a number of ,light rays, that act as ,photons, from the ,camera, out into the scene. These rays will eventually hit either: a light source, an object, or the world background. If these rays hit an object, they will bounce based on the angle of impact, and continue bouncing until a light source has been reached or until a maximum number of bounces, as determined by the user, which will cause it to terminate and result in a black, unlit pixel. Multiple rays are calculated and averaged out for each individual pixel, a process known as ""sampling"". This sampling number is set by the user and greatly affects the final image. Lower sampling often results in more noise and has the potential to create ""fireflies"" (which are uncharacteristically bright pixels), while higher sampling greatly reduces noise, but also increases render times.,
,The alternative is a ,branched path tracing, integrator, which works mostly the same way. Branched path tracing splits the light rays at each intersection with an object according to different surface components,,[,clarification needed,], and takes all lights into account for shading instead of just one. This added complexity makes computing each ray slower, but reduces noise in the render, especially in scenes dominated by direct (one-bounce) lighting.,
,Open Shading Language,[,edit,],
,Blender users can create their own ,nodes, using the ,Open Shading Language, (OSL), although it is important to note that this feature is not supported by GPUs.,[61],
,
,  ,Using the node editor to create ,anisotropic, metallic materials ,[,needs update,],
,Materials,[,edit,],
,Materials define the look of ,meshes,, ,NURBS curves,, and other geometric objects. They consist of three ,shaders, to define the mesh's surface appearance, volume inside, and surface displacement.,[57],
,
,Surface shader,[,edit,],
,The ,surface shader, defines the light interaction at the surface of the mesh. One or more bidirectional scattering distribution functions, or ,BSDFs,, can specify if incoming light is ,reflected,, ,refracted, into the mesh, or ,absorbed,.,[57], The ,alpha value, is one measure of translucency.
,
,Volume shader,[,edit,],
,When the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters the volume (light transmission). If no volume shader is specified, it will pass straight through (or be refracted, see ,refractive index or IOR,) to another side of the mesh.
,If one is defined, a ,volume shader, describes the light interaction as it passes through the volume of the mesh. Light may be ,scattered,, absorbed, or even ,emitted,[,clarification needed,], at any point in the volume.,[57],
,
,Displacement shader,[,edit,],
,The shape of the surface may be altered by ,displacement shaders,. In this way, ,textures, can be used to make the mesh surface more detailed.
,Depending on the settings, the displacement may be virtual – only modifying the ,surface normals, to give the impression of displacement (also known as ,bump mapping,) – real, or a combination of real displacement with bump mapping.,[57],
,
,Eevee,[,edit,],

,
,Development,[,edit,],
,  ,Game engine ,GLSL, materials,
,Since the opening of the source code, Blender has experienced significant ,refactoring, of the initial codebase and major additions to its feature set.
,Improvements include an animation system refresh;,[72], a stack-based modifier system;,[73], an updated particle system,[74], (which can also be used to simulate hair and fur); fluid dynamics; soft-body dynamics; GLSL shaders support,[75], in the game engine; advanced UV unwrapping;,[76], a fully recoded render pipeline, allowing separate render passes and ""render to texture""; node-based material editing and compositing; and projection painting.,[77],
,Part of these developments were fostered by ,Google,'s ,Summer of Code, program, in which the Blender Foundation has participated since 2005.
,
,Blender 2.8,[,edit,],
,Official planning for the next major revision of Blender after the 2.7 series began in the latter half of 2015, with potential targets including a more configurable UI (dubbed ""Blender 101""), support for ,Physically based rendering, (PBR) (dubbed EEVEE for ""Extra Easy Virtual Environment Engine"") to bring improved realtime 3D graphics to the viewport, allowing the use of C++11 and C99 in the codebase, moving to a newer version of ,OpenGL, and dropping support for versions before 3.2, and a possible overhaul of the particle and constraint systems.,[78],[79], Blender Internal renderer has been removed from 2.8.,[56], ,Code Quest, was a project started in April 2018 set in Amsterdam, at the Blender Institute.,[80], The goal of the project was to get a large development team working in one place, in order to speed up the development of Blender 2.8.,[80], By June 29, 2018, the Code Quest project ended, and on July 2, the alpha version was completed.,[81], Beta testing commenced on November 29, 2018 and was anticipated to take until July 2019.,[82], Blender 2.80 was released on July 30, 2019.,[83],
,
,Support,[,edit,],
,Blender is extensively documented on its website,,[84], with the rest of the support provided via community tutorials and discussion forums on the Internet. The Blender Network provides support and social services for Blender professionals. Additionally, ,YouTube, is known to have many video tutorials available.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Modified versions,[,edit,],
,Due to Blender's open-source nature, other programs have tried to take advantage of its success by repackaging and selling cosmetically-modified versions of it. Examples include IllusionMage, 3DMofun, 3DMagix, and Fluid Designer,,[85], the latter being recognized as Blender-based.

,Early life and education,[,edit,],
,Mullenweg was born in ,Houston,, Texas, and attended the ,High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, where he studied jazz ,saxophone,.,[4], He studied at the ,University of Houston,, majoring in ,Political Science,, before he dropped out in 2004 to pursue a job at ,CNET Networks,.,[5],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,  ,Mullenweg at WordCamp Germany 2009,
,In January 2003, Mullenweg and ,Mike Little, started ,WordPress, from the b2 codebase. They were soon joined by original b2 developer Michel Valdrighi. Mullenweg was 19 years old, and a freshman at the ,University of Houston, at the time.,[6],[7], He co-founded the ,Global Multimedia Protocols Group, (GMPG) in March 2004 with ,Eric Meyer, and ,Tantek Çelik,. GMPG wrote the first of the ,Microformats,. In April 2004, with fellow WordPress developer, they launched Ping-O-Matic, a hub for notifying blog ,search engines, like ,Technorati, about blog updates.,[8], The following month, WordPress competitor ,Movable Type, announced a radical price change, driving thousands of users to seek another blogging platform; this is widely seen as the tipping point for WordPress.,[9],
,In October 2004, he was recruited by CNET to work on WordPress for them and help them with blogs and new media offerings.,[10], He dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco from ,Houston,, Texas, the following month. Mullenweg announced bbPress in December,,[11], Mullenweg and the ,WordPress, team released WordPress 1.5 ""Strayhorn"" in February 2005, which had over 900,000 downloads.,[12], The release introduced their theme system, moderation features, and a redesign of the front and back end. In late March and early April, Andrew Baio found at least 168,000 hidden articles on the WordPress.org website that were using a technique known as ,cloaking,.,[13], Mullenweg admitted accepting the questionable advertisement and removed all articles from the domain.,[14],
,Mullenweg left CNET in October 2005 to focus on WordPress and related activities full-time,,[15], and announced ,Akismet, several days later.,[16], Akismet is a distributed effort to stop ,comment and trackback spam, by using the collective input of everyone using the service. In December, he announced Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and Akismet. Automattic employed people who had contributed to the WordPress project, including lead developer ,Ryan Boren, and WordPress MU creator Donncha Ó Caoimh. An Akismet licensing deal,[17], and WordPress bundling,[18], was announced with ,Yahoo!, Small Business web hosting about the same time.
,
,  ,Mullenweg at WordCamp Bulgaria 2011,
,In January 2006 Mullenweg recruited former ,Oddpost, CEO and ,Yahoo!, executive Toni Schneider to join Automattic as CEO, bringing the size of the company to 5. An April 2007 ,Regulation D, filing showed that Automattic raised approximately $1.1 million.,[19], Investors were ,Polaris Ventures,, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and CNET.
,Mullenweg runs an angel investment firm Audrey Capital, which has backed nearly 30 companies since 2008.,[20], In 2011 he backed ,Y Combinator, startup ,Earbits,.,[21],
,In January 2008 Automattic raised an additional $29.5 million for the company from ,Polaris Venture Partners,, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and the New York Times Company.,[22], According to Mullenweg's blog the funding was a result of spurned acquisition offers months before and the decision to keep the company independent. At the time the company had 18 employees.,[23], One of the reported plans for the funding was in a forum service called TalkPress.,[24],
,In January 2009, the ,San Francisco Business Times, reported that traffic to WordPress sites were growing faster than for Google's blogger service and significantly outstripped its nearest competitor, ,Six Apart,. A reporter at ,eMarketer, called Mullenweg ""quite an entrepreneur and visionary"" and compared WordPress' momentum over its competitors to Facebook's growing popularity over ,MySpace,.,[25],
,In February 2009, an interview with ,Power Magazine, called Mullenweg ""the Blog Prince"" and dispelled the myth that blogging was a passing trend and revealed that the company has seen a 10% month-on-month organic growth with more than 15,000 new blogs hosted by WordPress each day.,[26],
,In May 2009, Mullenweg's unwillingness to comply with Chinese censorship meant WordPress.com was effectively blocked by China's ,Golden Shield Project,.,[27],
,A ,Bloomberg, interview in April 2011 described the impressive scalability of the company. Monthly infrastructure costs were only $300,000 to $400,000 while powering 12% of the internet with 1,350 servers and 80 employees in 62 cities. The management of the global company excludes all internal email but instead communication is rooted in their P2theme.com blog theme.,[28],
,
,  ,Mullenweg at WordCamp Europe 2013,
,In July 2011, WordPress blogs pass the 50 million milestone, powering over 50 million blogs globally.,[29],
,In April 2012, ,Pingdom, reported that ""WordPress completely dominates top 100 blog"" and is in use by 49% of the top 100 blogs in the world. This is a huge increase from the 32% that was recorded 3 years ago.,[30], In May 2012, ,All Things D, reported that ""WordPress now powers 70 million sites... and expects to bring in $45 million in revenue this year."" The company has a very low rate of staff attrition: 106 employees whilst has only ever hired 118.,[31],
,In January 2014 Mullenweg became CEO of Automattic. Toni Schneider moved to work on new projects at Automattic.,[1], In the announcement Mullenweg joked ""it's obvious that no one in their twenties should run a company."",,[32], and a few months later in May raised $160 million in additional funding for the company, valuing the company at over a billion dollars, and WordPress was cited as powering ""22 percent of the world's top 10 million websites."",[33],
,Since 2005, Mullenweg has been a frequent keynote/speaker at conferences/events, including global ,WordCamp, events,,[34], SxSW,,[35], Web 2.0 Summit, YCombinator's Startup School,,[36], Le Web,,[37], Lean Startup Conference,,[38], and the ,International World Wide Web Conference,[39], etc.
,From 2017 to 2019, Mullenweg also served as a board member for GitLab, Inc.,[40],
,
,Awards and recognition,[,edit,],
,In March 2007, Mullenweg was named #16 of the 50 most important people on the web by ,PC World,,,[41], reportedly the youngest on the list.,[42], In October, Mullenweg acquired the ,Gravatar, service,[43], and was rumored to have turned down a US$200 million offer to buy his company ,Automattic,.,[44], In 2008, Mullenweg received the Information Technology Innovator Award – presented by ,Temple University,'s ,Fox School of Business and Management, to those who have applied Information Technology to create new business opportunities.,[45],
,In July 2008 Mullenweg was featured on the cover of ,Linux Journal,.,[46], Later that month a ,San Francisco Chronicle, story put him on the cover of the business section and noted he still drove a ,Chevrolet Lumina, and WordPress.com was ranked #31 on Alexa with 90 million monthly page views.,[47], In September, Mullenweg was being named to the Top 30 Entrepreneurs Under 30 by ,Inc. Magazine,[48], and one of the 25 Most Influential People on the Web by ,BusinessWeek,.,[49],
,In December 2010, Mullenweg was awarded the Winner of the TechFellow Award in ""Product Design and Marketing"".,[50], In January 2011, ,Business Insider, listed Mullenweg as #3 of their 30 Founders under 30 list for creating WordPress, the power behind many new startups.,[51],
,In March 2011, Mullenweg was named one of the top 10 most influential people online for changing the face of the internet by ,Business Insider,.,[52], In October 2011, Mullenweg made ,Vanity Fair,',s Next Establishment prestigious list of rising talents in tech, media, policy, and business.,[53], In December 2011, Mullenweg was listed in Forbes 30 Under 30 for Social/Mobile for the impact he has made on the blogging world through open source.
,[54],
,In May 2012, Mullenweg was listed in ,Forbes,'s, Most Influential Angel Investors on ,AngelList,.,[55], In December 2012, Mullenweg was listed in 2012 Forbes's 30 Under 30 in Media and received the 21st Annual ,Heinz Awards, in Technology, Employment and the Economy in 2016.,[56], ,[57],

,Mullenweg supports a number of philanthropic organizations including ,Archive.org,, ,Electronic Frontier Foundation,, ,Free Software Foundation,, ,Long Now,, and ,Innocence Project,. He is also a member of The Well at the non-profit ""Charity: Water"" organization (with which he traveled to Ethiopia in February 2012) where he supports providing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations. For his 28th birthday he started a campaign which raised over $28,000 for the cause,,[59], and then over $44,000 for his 30th.,[60], Mullenweg was a major supporter of ,The Bay Lights, project, both as the first donor and later helping to finish the project with a second $1.5 million donation.,[61],

,WordPress, (,WP,, ,WordPress.org,) is a free and open-source ,content management system, (CMS) written in ,PHP,[4], and paired with a ,MySQL, or ,MariaDB, database. Features include a ,plugin architecture, and a ,template system,, referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally created as a ,blog-publishing system, but has evolved to support other types of web content including more traditional ,mailing lists, and ,forums,, media galleries, membership sites, ,learning management systems, (LMS) and ,online stores,. WordPress is used by more than 60 million websites,,[5], including 33.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2019,[update],,,[6],[7], WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions in use.,[8], WordPress has also been used for other application domains such as ,pervasive display systems, (PDS).,[9],
,WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, American developer ,Matt Mullenweg,[1], and English developer ,Mike Little,,,[10],[11], as a ,fork, of ,b2/cafelog,. The software is released under the ,GPLv2, (or later) license.,[12],
,To function, WordPress has to be installed on a ,web server,, either part of an ,Internet hosting service, like ,WordPress.com, or a computer running the software package WordPress.org in order to serve as a ,network host, in its own right.,[13], A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes.

,Overview,
,""WordPress is a factory that makes webpages"",[14], is a core analogy designed to clarify the functions of WordPress: it stores content and enables a user to create and publish ,webpages,, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.
,WordPress has a ,web template system, using a ,template processor,. Its architecture is a ,front controller,, routing all requests for non-static ,URIs, to a single ,PHP, file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable ,permalinks,.,[15],
,
,Themes,
,WordPress users may install and switch among different ,themes,. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed  using WordPress standards with structured PHP, valid ,HTML, (HyperText Markup Language), and ,Cascading Style Sheets, (CSS). Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress ""Appearance"" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via ,FTP,.,[16], The ,PHP,, ,HTML, and ,CSS, found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a ""child"" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.,[17], WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.,[18],
,
,Plugins,
,WordPress' ,plugin, architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available,,[19], each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.  However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from ,search engine optimization (SEO),, to ,client portals, used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of ,widgets, and ,navigation bars,. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via ,FTP, or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.
,Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.
,
,Mobile applications,
,Phone apps for WordPress exist for ,WebOS,,,[20], ,Android,,,[21], ,iOS, (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),,[22],[23], ,Windows Phone,, and ,BlackBerry,.,[24], These applications, designed by ,Automattic,, have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.,[22],[23],
,
,Accessibility,
,The ,WordPress Accessibility Team, has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.,[25], The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design. The WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards state that ""All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA."",[26],
,
,Other features,
,WordPress also features integrated link management; a ,search engine,–friendly, clean ,permalink, structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for ,tagging, of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to ,smart quotes,). WordPress also supports the ,Trackback, and ,Pingback, standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.
,
,Multi-user and multi-blogging,
,Prior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.
,As of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.,[27],
,
,History,
,b2/cafelog,, more commonly known as ,b2, or ,cafelog,, was the precursor to WordPress.,[28], b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003.,[29], It was written in PHP for use with ,MySQL, by Michel Valdrighi, who is now a contributing developer to WordPress. Although WordPress is the official successor, another project, ,b2evolution,, is also in active development.
,WordPress first appeared in 2003 as a joint effort between ,Matt Mullenweg, and ,Mike Little, to create a ,fork, of b2.,[30], Christine Selleck Tremoulet, a friend of Mullenweg, suggested the name ,WordPress,.,[31],[32],
,In 2004 the licensing terms for the competing ,Movable Type, package were changed by ,Six Apart,, resulting in many of its most influential users migrating to WordPress.,[33],[34], By October 2009 the Open Source CMS MarketShare Report concluded that WordPress enjoyed the greatest brand strength of any open-source content management system.
,As of June 2019, WordPress is used by 60.8% of all the websites whose content management system is known. This is 27.5% of the top 10 million websites.,[6],[35],

,
,WordPress 5.0 ""Bebo"",
The December 2018 release of WordPress 5.0, ""Bebo"", is named in homage to the pioneering Cuban jazz musician ,Bebo Valdés,.,[89],  ,
,It included a new default editor ""Gutenberg"" – a block-based editor; it allows users to modify their displayed content in a much more user friendly way than prior iterations. Blocks are abstract units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a ,web page,.,[90], Past content that was created on WordPress pages is listed under what is referred to as a Classic Block.,[91], Prior to Gutenberg, there were several block-based editors available as WordPress plugins, e.g. ,Elementor,, and following the release of Gutenberg it was compared to existing plugins.,[92],[93],
,
,Classic Editor plugin,
,The Classic Editor Plugin was created as result of User preferences and as a way to help website developers to maintain past plugins only compatible with WordPress 4.9.8 giving plugin developers time to get their plugins updated & compatible with the 5.0 release. Having the Classic Editor plugin installed restores the ""classic"" editing experience that WordPress has had up until the WordPress 5.0 release.,[94], The Classic Editor Plugin will be supported at least until 2022.,[95],
,The Classic Editor plugin is active on over 5,000,000 installations of WordPress.,[96],
,
,Vulnerabilities,
,Many security issues,[97], have been uncovered in the software, particularly in 2007, 2008, and 2015. According to ,Secunia,, WordPress in April 2009 had seven unpatched security advisories (out of 32 total), with a maximum rating of ""Less Critical"". Secunia maintains an up-to-date list of WordPress vulnerabilities.,[98],
,In January 2007, many high-profile ,search engine optimization, (SEO) blogs, as well as many low-profile commercial blogs featuring ,AdSense,, were targeted and attacked with a WordPress exploit.,[99], A separate vulnerability on one of the project site's ,web servers, allowed an attacker to introduce exploitable code in the form of a ,back door, to some downloads of WordPress 2.1.1. The 2.1.2 release addressed this issue; an advisory released at the time advised all users to upgrade immediately.,[100],
,In May 2007, a study revealed that 98% of WordPress blogs being run were exploitable because they were running outdated and unsupported versions of the software.,[101], In part to mitigate this problem, WordPress made updating the software a much easier, ""one click"" automated process in version 2.7 (released in December 2008).,[102], However, the filesystem security settings required to enable the update process can be an additional risk.,[103],
,In a June 2007 interview, Stefan Esser, the founder of the PHP Security Response Team, spoke critically of WordPress' security track record, citing problems with the application's architecture that made it unnecessarily difficult to write code that is secure from ,SQL injection, vulnerabilities, as well as some other problems.,[104],
,In June 2013, it was found that some of the 50 most downloaded WordPress plugins were vulnerable to common Web attacks such as SQL injection and ,XSS,. A separate inspection of the top-10 e-commerce plugins showed that seven of them were vulnerable.,[105],
,In an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall, automatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7.,[106],
,Individual installations of WordPress can be protected with security plugins that prevent user enumeration, hide resources and thwart probes. Users can also protect their WordPress installations by taking steps such as keeping all WordPress installation, themes, and plugins updated, using only trusted themes and plugins,,[107], editing the site's ,.htaccess, configuration file if supported by the web server to prevent many types of SQL injection attacks and block unauthorized access to sensitive files. It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be ,hackers, can easily list all the plugins a site uses, and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their own files (such as a ,web shell,) that collect sensitive information.
,Developers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as a ,CSRF,, ,LFI,, ,RFI,, ,XSS,, SQL injection and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes and other add-ins from other developers.
,In March 2015, it was reported by many security experts and SEOs, including Search Engine Land, that a ,SEO, plugin for WordPress called Yoast which is used by more than 14 million users worldwide has a vulnerability which can lead to an exploit where hackers can do a Blind SQL injection.,[108],[109], To fix that issue they immediately introduced a newer version 1.7.4 of the same plugin to avoid any disturbance on web because of the security lapse that the plugin had.,[110],
,In January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress ,REST API, that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater. The auditors quietly notified WordPress developers, and within six days WordPress released a high priority patch to version 4.7.2 which addressed the problem.,[111],[112],
,
,  ,The ,canvas fingerprinting, warning that is typically given by ,Tor Browser, for WordPress-based websites.,
,As of WordPress 5.2, the minimum PHP version requirement is PHP 5.6,,[113], which was released on August 28, 2014,,[114], and which has been unsupported by the PHP Group and not received any security patches since December 31, 2018.,[114], Thus, WordPress recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater.,[113],
,In the absence of specific alterations to their default formatting code, WordPress-based websites use the ,canvas element, to detect whether the browser is able to correctly render ,emoji,. Because ,Tor Browser, does not currently discriminate between this legitimate use of the ,Canvas, ,API, and an effort to perform ,canvas fingerprinting,, it warns that the website is attempting to 'extract HTML5 canvas image data'. Ongoing efforts seek workarounds to reassure privacy advocates while retaining the ability to check for proper emoji rendering capability.,[115],
,
,Development and support,
,Key developers,
,Matt Mullenweg, and ,Mike Little, were co-founders of the project. The core lead developers include Helen Hou-Sandí, Dion Hulse, Mark Jaquith, Matt Mullenweg, Andrew Ozz, and Andrew Nacin.,[116],[117],
,WordPress is also developed by its community, including ,WP testers,, a group of volunteers who test each release. They have early access to ,nightly builds,, beta versions and release candidates. Errors are documented in a special ,mailing list, or the project's ,Trac, tool.
,Though largely developed by the community surrounding it, WordPress is closely associated with ,Automattic,, the company founded by Matt Mullenweg.,[118], On September 9, 2010, Automattic handed the WordPress trademark to the newly created WordPress Foundation, which is an umbrella organization supporting WordPress.org (including the software and archives for plugins and themes), ,bbPress, and ,BuddyPress,.
,
,WordCamp developer and user conferences,
,  ,A WordCamp in ,Sofia,, ,Bulgaria, (2011),
,WordCamps are casual, locally organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress.,[119], The first such event was WordCamp 2006 in August 2006 in ,San Francisco,, which lasted one day and had over 500 attendees.,[120],[121], The first WordCamp outside San Francisco was held in ,Beijing, in September 2007.,[122], Since then, there have been over 1,022 WordCamps in over 75 cities in 65 different countries around the world.,[119], WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was the last official annual conference of WordPress developers and users taking place in San Francisco, having now been replaced with WordCamp US.,[123], First ran in 2013 as WordCamp Europe, regional WordCamps in other geographical regions are held with the aim of connecting people who aren't already active in their local communities and inspire attendees to start user communities in their hometowns.,[124], In 2019, the ,Nordic region, had its own WordCamp Nordic.,[125],[126], The first WordCamp ,Asia, was to be held in 2020,,[127], but cancelled due to the ,COVID-19 pandemic,.,[128],
,
,Support,
,WordPress' primary support website is WordPress.org. This support website hosts both WordPress Codex, the online manual for WordPress and a living repository for WordPress information and documentation,,[129],
and WordPress Forums, an active online community of WordPress users.,[130],

,  ,Bram Moolenaar in 2007,
,  ,The logo of the Vim text editor,
,Bram Moolenaar, (born 1961, ,Lisse,) is a ,Dutch, ,computer programmer, and an active member of the ,open-source software, community. He is the original author, maintainer, ,release manager,, and ,benevolent dictator for life, of ,Vim,,,[1], a ,vi,-derivative text editor that is very popular among programmers and ,power users,. Since July 2006, Moolenaar has been employed by ,Google,,,[2],[3], working in the ,Zürich, office.,[4], He is able to spend part of his time maintaining Vim.,[2],

,Charity work and awards,[,edit,],
,Moolenaar is an advocate of the ,ICCF, charity, encouraging people to support orphans in ,Uganda,. He pioneered a methodology called ,charityware, through ,Vim,.,[5], The software itself is available for free, but it encourages the user to donate to the programmer's favorite charity.,[6], A number of other applications have been licensed this way since the inception of this concept.,[7], The opening ""splash"" screen for Vim encourages support of ICCF.
,Moolenaar has been a member of the Dutch Unix user group, ,NLUUG,, which presented him with an award,[8], during its 25th anniversary, for his creation of Vim and his contributions to open source software in general.
,
,Vim,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Vim (text editor),
,  ,The opening screen of Vim,
,The Vim editor started as ""Vi IMitation"" on the ,Amiga, in 1988, but was later relabeled ""Vi IMproved"",[9], and ported to many other platforms. As ,vi, was a popular editor amongst programmers and system administrators, initially there was doubt whether Bram's 'improved' version could achieve the quality and fan following of the original. But since its first release for Unix systems in 1992, Vim has effectively eclipsed the original Vi, having won several awards,[10], and has been referred to as one of the most popular text editors.,[11],[12],[13],
,
,Other software,[,edit,],
,Other software tools that Moolenaar has developed include a software build tool written in ,Python,, called ,A-A-P,,,[14], which is similar to ,make,, and a programming language called ,Zimbu,[15], which puts an emphasis on readability of programs.  Bram is also an assurer for the ,non-profit, ,certificate authority, ,CAcert,, which means that he is eligible to verify the identities of people using the CAcert ,web of trust, model. Amongst all of Moolenaar's contributions to the field of computer science, the Vim editor remains his most prominent and widely used application.
